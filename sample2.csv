ATA Creativity Global,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"You mentioned Q1 revenue growth was primarily due to portfolio training services. Could you tell us how we should think about enrollment in portfolio training and your thoughts on its growth trajectory? I mean, do you feel it can continue to grow at its current rate I believe you mentioned about 30% in Q1.","Hi, Louis, and thanks for your question. And yes, and we have a strong first quarter with revenues from the business increase, nearly 50%, due to a 24.9% increase in student enrollment and 21.3% increase in credit hours delivered. And a program of our portfolio training services business can be measured in a few different ways, and student enrollment, the number of credit hours delivered, and the union price per credit hour delivered. For the union price, we have continued to encourage students to be optimistic for the project-based programs, overtime-based, and they are designed to be more flexible and customizable and adjustable according to students' needs. For this reason, we achieved a higher union price and for project-based programs. And enrollment growth was primarily a result of our sales team and with additional hearings, and we are able to successfully deliver more credit hours and with the hearing of more full-time teaching staff, which will also support future growth in the line of business. We have continued to realize economics of scale and business has grown, and students have continued to express interest in our portfolio training services. And we believe that ongoing investment in teaching resources will enable us to meet students' demands and drive sustainable growth. In addition, our sales team has been working closely with teaching staff who have been increasingly engaged in program design and sales efforts. For the sales members, that we have gathered internally. We believe this is a certain room to grow our portfolio training services business, which remains our core business and we will subsequently be a key growth and driven from ACG.

Actually, I think for the next two or three quarters, I think the first part of our corporate business and portfolio training was a stable growth in the following period. Besides of this, I think our portfolio is getting bigger and bigger. I think for the next two or three quarters, our main revenue and the sales benefits will still come from this part.

"Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to ask about the capacity investments. I guess 135 or so million mid-range and pretty substantial in Q4 as well. I guess to what extent is that I imagine it's principally focused on data center, but maybe you could provide some color, data center versus cable, because it looks like you're going to continue to ramp there. And within data center, could you give us an estimate of the kind of capacity you're heading towards, whether that's revenue or incremental revenue capacity or unit volumes or however you'd like to discuss it? And as you close the year, what kind of annual revenue capacity are you targeting in the U.S.?","Okay, so there's a lot embedded in there. As far as the application of the capital expenditures, it's going to be almost entirely for data center. There will be some spending on cable TV as well, but most of that ramp has already been accommodated in terms of production capacity. As far as what this would bring to us in terms of incremental capacity, You know, it's going to be designed for production of primarily 800 gig and 1.6 terabits. We're still working with our customers and other related parties to figure out exactly how much of that capacity is going to be built in the U.S. versus other locations. So I can't answer that question directly, but it's going to be substantially targeted at U.S. investment. And again, mostly for 800 gig and 1.6 terabits. So let me give you the answer. The other is for the laser, the manufacturer in Houston. So we're getting to the 4-inch manufacturer for the EML and the high-power single-mode laser. For 800G 1.6T, I think our plan to have maybe more than 120,000 or even 140,000 per month of capacity by end of this year of early next year.

So I'm kind of wondering, is that like a number that would have to be repeated in the next year? Or, or does that get you multiple years of revenue growth?","So one would say 150? Let's put it this way. Our hope is that we're going to continue to make sizable capital investments because that means that our revenue in the future is expected to continue to ramp, which is what I think, based on what we're hearing from our data center customers, this is a multi-year upgrade cycle that they're going through with respect to their AI data centers. And to that extent, if we're participating in that, then our expectation is that we would continue to see increased demand you know, not just 2025 and we're done. So, you know, I can't give you any kind of guidance on what we're going to be in 2026 in terms of CapEx, but, you know, I think it would be a very good sign if we continue to invest, you know, substantial amounts. Well, let me say that based on the information we have from four or five customers, I think by end of next year, The demand for the 800G 1.6T single mode transceiver could be more than $200,000 per month or even $250,000 per month.

So that's, again, you know, as we said in our prepared remarks, We think a 40% margin is a good long-term target for us to have, and growth in both energy, 1.6 terabits, and cable is really what it's going to take to get there.","The question inquires about the potential for higher margins from cable TV and data center transitions to 800G and 1.6 terabits.

So the question is, does that remain the case? And then is you know, maybe try and comment on some details on what's driving that. Sounds like ASCs at Microsoft should be ramping up, also your new 400 gig transceiver customer. You mentioned you also expect some 800 gig revenue. If you look at that, I don't know if it's 30 million or so sequential increase in data center, can you give a sense of what are the different factors and or customers driving that?","Yeah, so overall our expectations regarding Q4 are pretty much what we communicated last time. We do see continued growth in cable, but we also see strong growth in the data center, largely driven by 400G at this point, as has been the case for a while for us. We do actually see some continuing strength in 100G as well, interestingly enough. And then the 800G will be a factor for us a little bit in Q4, but it won't likely be material in Q4, but it should start to ramp in Q1. So that's kind of how things break down.

"Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to ask some questions about Microsoft. Like, if you had any more color on why you think that it's going slower than initially expected. But then secondly, how do you expect orders to trend in the second quarter? Do you see orders in the month of June being above the month of May? Is there any visibility to that? And then finally, it sounds like your comments on the overall side of this, of 300 million plus, have maybe gotten a little bit more bullish. But maybe that's because you've added 800G to it. So if you could help us understand that as well.","Sure. First of all, I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. I was just reminding you the first one was why the delay. Yeah, I wouldn't really say it's an overall delay. If my prepared remarks sounded that way, that's not what I was trying to say. There was a slight delay in one particular program, which really just reflects the fact that it's a new product. And sometimes new product launches just take a little longer than expected. There's nothing particular that I can point to with respect to that. It is positive that we're getting new updated forecasts now that we didn't expect to see. We're not going to be able to communicate shipments beginning later in Q2 and then ramping quickly in Q3 and Q4. So that's all positive. I wouldn't read much into the delay itself. Overall, the revenue in our data center business is about where we expected it to be in Q2. So there's not really a significant change from our earlier thinking. That small delay in the business for Microsoft is being more than compensated by other data center customers. So it's not anything overall that I'm trying to point to there. Just that one particular product that's got some of the delay. Your second question had to do with the $300 million target and whether that represents a change. No, fundamentally, other than that, you know, we mentioned that we're having to pull in 800 gig and 1.6 terabits faster. Now, 1.6 terabits won't be a factor this year, but it will be early next year. But the acceleration in 800 gig is certainly helpful to try to meet that goal. And then I'm sorry, I forgot your third question there. What was it?","The question inquired about Microsoft's slower-than-expected progress, order trends for the second quarter, and the implications of a $300 million target. The response clarified that the perceived delay was due to a specific new product, not overall performance, and noted that revenue expectations remain stable, with positive forecasts for upcoming quarters.",0,2,-0.9999995,0.055555554,7,2,0.555555494,0.249999993,2,8,-0.59999994,0.086206896,17,18,-0.028571428,0.301724135,4,0,0,1,0,0
"Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Well, I'll tie that in with my next and last question. But it was about the orders. If for instance, you think that if there's a reason to think as you're seeing these forecasts that for instance, June would be up from May, which is up from April, if you're seeing that kind of trend at this customer. But I might as well just ask. I mean, you said one Q data center revenues were about where you expected them to be. How do you see them trending in 2Q and 3Q, if you could address that?","I want to be clear. Yeah, well, first of all, maybe I misspoke earlier. Q1 and Q2 data center numbers are about what we expected them to be. Cable TV and Q2 is coming in a little lighter than what we had expected. And that explains to the extent that we didn't give guidance until now in Q2, but to the extent that there was some change in our thinking. It had to do with cable TV, not data center. Data center overall is doing almost, you know, actually slightly ahead of plan compared to where we thought it was going to be. I mentioned earlier Microsoft had a delay in one product, but the rest of them are going to find. And that slight delay in that one product was more than compensated for in Q2 by growth and other customers. So with respect to. So this is Thompson. Let me say that. I think overall for data center, I think we feel more positive right now compared to a few months ago. The main reason is -hundred-G. Right now, I think at least we can see several big customers, especially two hyper-scale data customers, are pulling in the schedule for -hundred-G. But cable TV, you know, cable TV is quite slow because all the customers are waiting for one point -hundred-G product. So, you know, usually the delay in cable TV is not surprising, as you can see from other companies. Michael, I just want to touch on your last question there. I'll try to answer it directly. Yeah. You know, are we seeing a trend of more orders kind of month by month? And the answer is yes. As I mentioned earlier, you know, that one program, for example, for Microsoft, it's somewhat delayed. We do expect it to pick up towards the end of this quarter. So that would mean June months would be bigger than May. And that was certainly bigger than April. So we are seeing that trend with that product. But overall, we expect to see that trend somewhat throughout the quarter. Although, again, I would say for the most part, the data center business outside some of these new programs, and especially the -hundred-G products later in the year, is, you know, it's a relatively consistent business at this point.","The question inquires about the expected trends in data center revenues for Q2 and Q3, particularly in relation to customer forecasts. The answer indicates that data center revenues are performing slightly better than expected, with a positive trend anticipated for June compared to May and April, although cable TV revenues are lagging due to delays in product releases.",0,1,-0.999999,0.037037036,3,1,0.499999875,0.148148143,1,7,-0.749999906,0.05479452,27,13,0.349999991,0.273972601,3,0,0,5,0,0
"Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"With the new OPEX forecast, it seems like maybe something reasonably over $300 million is what you would need to get you there. And so that's a pretty significant ramp in the second half, you know, almost 3X over the first. Although, we've seen that recently, a couple different places, most recently at Coherent. So I guess as you look at that ramp and the -hundred-G opportunities in particular, I'm hoping you might be able to size those for us in a fashion maybe similar or analogous to how you've been talking about the Microsoft 400-gig opportunity. And you've talked about new data center customers or some old data center customers coming back. Should we assume this discussion around 800-gig and 1.60 also applies to Microsoft or is it more focused on the new players?","No, I mean, we specifically, maybe it wasn't totally clear from the prepared remarks, but it's our existing customers that we have now, plus the new customers for those 800-gig and 1.60 terabit products. So Microsoft clearly would be included in the category of existing customers. And as far as the size of the market, you know, what we're seeing right now is that 800-gig is several times as large as the 400-gig opportunity. So it represents, you know, a dramatic expansion. And that's within the same customer.

Obviously, a lot of it is customer sensitive. But at this point, it started to ramp, as I noted in our prepared remarks, we shipped product in December, which was ahead of schedule. The data center, the individual data centers where those are getting installed are taking a little bit longer than expected to actually deploy those transceivers in the data center. So there's a bit of a lull right now while that goes on. And then we expect the ramp to resume later in this quarter and ramp throughout the year.

And I'm not quite sure what you mean by back end use cases, but it's supporting AI in the connections between the GPU cluster and the switch primarily. Now, I mean, I think it's also likely being used in other non AI applications as well. I mean, there are other non AI compute applications out there.

Anything you could do to give us some sort of bounds on what that implies?","Yeah, I mean, I think you're you're you're more or less correct in what you're saying in terms of the step function in the middle of the year. What's going on right now is that we're continuing to sell, you know, DOCSIS 3.1 products, which are, you know, on their way out. They're not obsolete yet.

But those products that are being shipped now are being used in, you know, new new new builds, you know, not upgrades, but just new areas that need to be built out or repairs, things like that. It's kind of a steady state business. What we expect to happen in the middle part of the year is that we'll layer on the new one point eight gigahertz products, which are going to be used in new network upgrades, which is which is really where the excitement is, frankly. And that's why we tried to call out some specific dates in our prepared remarks earlier that we expect to have those amplifiers in for qualification between April and June. There's several different models there, so they'll ship at various times within that time frame.

That was the end of the question. Go ahead. I mean, yeah, so I guess I was going to also ask for more color on that. But also, you know, if that is in fact the case, you know, I hear you reiterating the $300 million number that hasn't changed. But what else can give us confidence that this is just a tiny delay and not not any other kind of fundamental change here?","Sure. So, first of all, I guess, you know, some commentary on, you know, the slower start to the year that we're seeing, specifically with the data center deployment that I mentioned earlier. So, you know, these things are difficult to predict. What happens is that the the product is is, you know, qualified and put into use data centers order an initial quantity of it to begin putting product in there. And then they start to deploy. And, you know, I'm sure you can probably understand, you know, just based on prudence that, you know, they don't always deploy the new technology as fast as they will once it's at scale. Right. They want to take it slow and make sure there's no issues. And I believe that's probably the most likely explanation for what's going on. And then, you know, once that once that initial phase of deployments proves that it's going well, then the order, you know, larger quantity to continue the deployment. As far as, you know, what we expect to see throughout the rest of the year.

So, you know, as far as what can give you the confidence there, I think probably the, you know, the only thing that I could really point to is the fact that we continue to invest pretty heavily in capex. If you look at our capex in the fourth quarter, it's ramped significantly from what it was earlier in the year. Clearly, not all of that investment, you know, came online and produced products in Q1. And so I think, you know, that along with our commentary about, you know, a markedly improved Q2 would hopefully give you guys some level of confidence that, you know, that this is a temporary condition.

As we mentioned, Microsoft is accelerating their demand for the new products that we've been discussing. based on the new contracts that we have, and that's really positive for us. I mean, there's a limit to how fast we can speed up the production, of course, so it's not going to dramatically change our revenue picture in the fourth quarter, but we're encouraged by the increase in demand that we're seeing.

And I'd love it if you can give us a sense of what that looks like for you guys from a revenue standpoint or what might that look like.","Sure. So your question about Q4 I think is – The answer to that is that we're just beginning the production in Q4, so we don't expect it to meaningfully contribute to revenue in Q4. The reason for the commentary that we've been giving is just to illustrate the fact that the demand is still very strong for Microsoft. And, in fact, I believe from other data center operators as well, as we talked about. However, our ability to increase the production capacity, is, you know, we're doing the best that we can, but it's going to take us a little bit of time to get there, right? So we're not going to be fully ramped right at the beginning of Q1 either. There'll be some continued ramp during Q1.

It's not going to be done in, you know, a month or even a quarter. So there'll be some improvement throughout the year in terms of our capacity there.

How much NRE revenue or development revenue are we counting on? That's right. Okay. Okay. So there is some of that in there. For nondisclosure reasons, I can't give you the exact total in there, but there is some of that in there. But really, the bulk of the increase in margin is coming from increased margins on the products that we're selling, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks.

"Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Maybe you could ask a question about kind of what's happening at Microsoft, your biggest data center customer. So on the one hand, you look to be developing this active optical cable product for what I assume to be a very high-speed application, 800 gig, I'd suppose, maybe 400 as well. associated with an AI build-out, and yet you're also prior to that seeing some pretty strong increases in volumes and maybe pricing as well, given the gross margin movement on the current module product.

I mean, we've seen Microsoft with a pretty dramatic uptick in spending here this quarter that's expected to continue really for the next several quarters. So from your perspective, I'd be interested on kind of what's happening sort of short-term versus medium-term there with regard to data center connectivity demand.","Well, without going into too many details that would be difficult to disclose publicly due to our relationship there, I think your observation that Microsoft has been investing heavily is a very apt explanation.

And so they're definitely adding a lot of optical modules, a lot of interconnect modules now. And their expectation based on the contracts that we've supplied in terms of active optical cables certainly would indicate to us that they expect to continue to see strong demand mainly driven by AI applications, although certainly the sort of general purpose compute is also a part of that. And it would seem to imply that, you know, that's expected to be, you know, in pretty strong demand for Microsoft for several years, at least, as we noted in our prepared remarks. I mean, if you kind of look at Some of the forecasts that we've received from them and the contractual, the minimum contractual levels of manufacturing that they've asked us to prepare, that would imply revenue of $300 million plus over the next few years, you know, just in those products, not counting existing, you know, other types of business that they might have.

Apple Inc.,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about, you know, upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive. And overall, any impact that Apple intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales.","There's a lot there. On Apple intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. AND BUT WE JUST LAUNCHED IT THREE DAYS AGO AND SO WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW FROM A DATA POINT POINT OF VIEW IS THE NUMBER I JUST REFERENCED THAT 18-1 HAS TWICE THE ADOPTION RATE OF 17-1 SO THAT CLEARLY SHOWS A LEVEL OF INTEREST OUT THERE. IN TERMS OF EXITING THE DECEMBER QUARTER WITH demand greater than supply. That's not my recollection that that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and some spilled over. But in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a hundred year flood kind of thing. We would, our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so if you look at how we've done this year, We did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 pro family, the pro and the pro max. We've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that... That's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.","Tim discusses the current iPhone 16 cycle, noting that early demand indicators, such as adoption rates for new features, are promising.

You know, there's plenty debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices and the impact that'll have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward?","Yes, Eric, as you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter, and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year, the entire fiscal year of 24. They're really for our company record levels of gross margin and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board. I think it's a very good sign.","The question addresses concerns about input costs and their impact on gross margins, specifically asking for insights on commodity prices.

Apple Inc.,Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are? And what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter a new iPhone cycle?","Yes. Hi, Eric. The install base hit an all-time high during the quarter, and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency, and the 15, as you point out, If you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple intelligence, we are very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.","Tim noted that the iPhone install base reached an all-time high, with the iPhone 15 performing better than the 14 in its initial weeks.

Apple Inc.,Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare, you know, that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole, how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward.","Yeah, Eric, as you point out, we decreased by six and a half percent year over year for the whole of greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than three. So over 50 percent of the decline year over year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year. And so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for greater China, the install base set a record. We also in mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders. And so that's a very strong signal. And in fact, from Kantar, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. ALSO, IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK AT IS THE 15 FAMILY COMPARED TO THE 14 FAMILY FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF WEEKS FROM LAUNCH. SO THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SEPTEMBER of 23. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, One of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in mainland China, the majority of customers buying are buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time. And the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in greater China as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China.

It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix within products.

Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help mitigate some rising costs, if at all, rising input costs, if at all?","Yes, I mean, during the last quarter, commodity costs and in general component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period, not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities go in cycles. And so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from uh a very high level of gross margins you know we reported 46.6 which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades and so we're starting from a good point uh as you know we uh try to uh buy ahead when you know the cycles are favorable to us and so we will try to mitigate if there are there are headwinds uh but in general we feel particularly for this cycle uh we are in good shape.","Luca addressed concerns about rising commodity costs affecting product gross margins, stating that overall, commodity and component costs have been favorable recently, despite slight increases in memory prices.

That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the top two in urban China are iPhones.

Apple Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Luca, maybe if we start with you, can you unpackage some of the services drivers a bit for us? Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations, a record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about services growth for the March quarter and then speak to some of those underlying drivers, you know, in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be.","Thanks, Eric, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, 23.1 billion is an all-time record for us. with all time records in the Americas, in Europe and the rest of Asia pack. So it was a pretty broad base geographically and very strong across all the services categories because we had all time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising, and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important, and paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago, so obviously very significant growth there.

Hi, Eric. I would say emerging markets have been a very key area of strength for us.

Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of, you know, what some of your assumptions are, and then have a quick follow-up.","Yeah, we'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter.

We're obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before.

I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin?","On the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually December is the quarter where our products business tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. And so the services gross margins that are accretive to total company have an impact but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year.

Obviously, you absorbed a higher FX impact this quarter versus your guide, and you also noted services acceleration. So, just wondering, you know, when you think about that comment on iPhone acceleration, is that on a reported basis? Is that constant currency basis? And is there something that's changing in terms of seasonality perhaps for you that is causing not as much step up in product revenue as typical on a sequential basis?","Yes. So all our comments are in reported currency, not in constant currency in relation to the outlook. And we said acceleration sequentially for iPhone and for services. But we're also pointing out, and this is where I think, Wamsim, you're referring to some seasonality issues, we also said that for Mac and iPad, we expect to decline double digits. And the reason for that is that we have a very difficult compare versus last year. You remember that a year ago in the June quarter, we had factory shutdowns. for both Mac and iPad. And so we were able to fill the pent-up demand from those shutdowns during the September quarter. So an unusual level of activity that we had a year ago.

The majority of iPhones at this point are sold using some kind of a program. trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing. And that percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets.

Taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi.

Do you see a catch-up on the pro models specifically in the March quarter, and was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones?","Sure. It's hard to quantify, Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter. And obviously we had to set the channel at the right levels, and we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis.

Apple Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well, you talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October-November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or bills that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward?","This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, We're now at a point where production is what we need it to be, and so the problem is behind us. In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world and the final assembly coming from from three countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve. I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like, and I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate.

Apple Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margin. The guidance, especially 43.5 to 44.5 is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there? some mix and some other things. And then, you know, how should we think about what currency and hedging is going to do as we look forward?","Shannon? Yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business. But we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter, on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yeah, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course, you know, mix will continue to help both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.","Luca highlighted that strong gross margin guidance of 43.5% to 44.5% is supported by favorable product mix and cost management, despite challenges from foreign exchange fluctuations.

What are they buying, and how are you thinking about your position there?","Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis.

Apple Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Luca, obviously the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then, you know, what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into March quarter?","Yeah, Eric, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range, given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range. because of supply challenges in the year-ago quarter. Not related, not the same issue by, just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included In our color that Luca provided, kind of our thinking, it's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down, and it takes a while to get those reports. in during the quarter.

Yeah, there has been a lot going on for the last several months. You're absolutely right. Look, I think that we used to say this in prior years, and it served us well when we were focused in this manner, that top priority for us is, from a growth perspective, is net new customers, is continuing to build our brand, to put ourselves in a position to grow customer numbers, both folks using our platform and subscribing to our platform is our number one focus as a company. The second really is more of a financial focus of Steve and myself is to really challenge the management teams and ourselves to continue to push the envelope on our capital allocation strategy to generate additional cash from operations that we can then accelerate debt repayments while investing in the business. And that is number two. Number three is really the product platform and roadmap, where we're headed, what we're building, listening to our customer, and continuing to theme out this We Love You More concept to our customer base globally.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"You listed out 10 products to help you drive the subscription mix higher. What two or three products were really are going to help the most with that effort? And then secondly, how would you describe your go-to-market strategy to drive that subscription mix higher?","Yeah, I think it's important to point out, and what we wanted to do today because of all the noise of compliance and the change of our business strategy and our go-to-market strategy, is to really highlight those products individually so folks understood what the drivers are. I think the number one product for us still and likely will be for several years is going to be our news distribution element. We believe we've got a very compelling architecture, customer journey platform, and omni-channel system that can help us drive growth there. I said in the closing remarks there that we're We're really close to, you know, the third largest newswire. We don't have aspirations to be the third. We want to be number two and fight our way to number one at some point in volumes. So that is the driving reason. To be fair, one of the reasons why we rebranded ourselves is Access Newswire. Folks know us as that brand. We're in the dateline of tens of thousands of articles that go out every single quarter with our name on it. So that is the driver. It's kind of the hook to bring the customer into us. And it is our job then to sell them these ecosystems or platforms, if you will, both for IR and PR. And look, I think that, as everybody knows, we come from a background of investor relations and compliance and the whole bit. But to be fair, the total addressable market for us in the public relations side and the marketing PR side of the business is infinitely larger. and we've really got to focus there. And that's why we separated those products in different subscriptions. So we believe that the Access PR subscription product will be kind of the second, you know, culmination of volume and growth for us that includes distribution, monitoring, database, and pitching. And we'll add elements to that as time goes on, but that's really going to be the number two driver for us.","The key products driving subscription growth are the news distribution element and the Access PR subscription, which will help attract customers and expand into the larger public relations market.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,And then just how would you describe your go-to-market strategy today?,"Yeah, I think it's not really much different, but the audience members may be, right? It's the one platform, the one check, the one contact is extremely important to the market. When we examine the point solution providers, they're all grappling, trying to figure out ways to add more solutions to their platform to keep their customers sticky. If we examine the quadrant of folks that we compete with most, they still have fragmented platforms. So that efficiency gain is really a top one or two for our customer decision-making process. You know, the second, I think, to be fair, in the SMB kind of small micro-cap spaces, price is a driver. We've done really good at bringing efficiencies out of our systems and cost controlling to be able to deliver a solution, you know, at or below, what the incumbent is today and provide significant amount of value to that. I think the underpinning of some of this is, and we talked about this in prior calls, as we build scale in the system and fixed cost to deliver, this is now becoming more of a subscription product that allows a customer to kind of unlock the value of everything, use the entire platform for a fixed fee. And that is something that's never been done in the market before. There's always been incremental charges for press releases, incremental charges for pitching and monitoring, changes, support. It goes on and on. So again, back to this one kind of ecosystem, customers are now recognizing the fact that we have not only kind of turned the industry upside down in some ways with this platform fixed price, but also giving them more tools than they can get from any single platform. So- There's a bunch going on there, and the sales team has a lot more, obviously. But those are good highlights, Mike.","The go-to-market strategy focuses on offering a unified platform that enhances customer retention through efficiency and cost control, particularly in the SMB sector.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"The press release talks about gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, improving those. Do you have any medium-term goals there, what that financial profile could look like or might look like?","Yeah, I think, you know, look, with some of the automations we talked about today from a product roadmap perspective, we're going to gain further efficiencies in headcount by using some of these AI natural language processing systems. But by doing that enables us to probably increase 20% in scale of volume without additional headcount. And everybody knows editorial as a headcount, it's a cost of goods. So we think gross margins can grow in the category, probably 2% to 4% over the next 12 months. So blended... Gross margins on news distribution only are likely 78%. So we can climb into the low 80s with blended gross margins probably high 70s and touching 80 here within the next 12 months. And that's naturally just going to fall to the bottom line. So as we model out the business and think about returning to high teens and 20s EBITDA, we want to push this thing into the kind of 22%, 23% range long term. And we feel that scale... will help us.

That's a good question. And I think something we've discussed openly in investor presentations and likely other past quarterly calls. I would tell you our main objective today is to continue to get back to generating cash the way we had in the past, continue to service our debt, and pay full attention to our ratios there to meet bank confidence. If that continues and we generate excessive cash that we plan, we would likely seriously consider at these levels or when that time happens if the levels are the same to look at a repurchase program.

And so that's, you know, and many folks know as a significant channel, that's a benefit to all of us. And we surely want to do it. Any potential disposal of part of our compliance business may result in a portion of repayment of debt and stock repurchase.

Right, I think to be fair to our shareholders and the business and our customers and employees equally all across the board is, it's like I said, our main objective is to service that debt, continue to grow the business and invest in the areas that we can. And so I view capital allocation as kind of a multi-pronged approach and repurchasing shares is one of them. It's a great way to do it. It has proved well in the past for us.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"I actually just got disconnected there at the end so apologies if this is a repeat at all, but I was just gonna say it's great to see the bounce back in volumes, especially from last quarter's comments about kind of expecting it to be flat throughout the year. So I was just wondering if this was kind of directly due to just elevated distribution across the market and competitors were up to, or if this was specific to issue or direct in the new product suite and sales hires and just trying to get a sense of it there was some more market share gain here during the quarter.","Yeah, definitely more market share gain as has been attributable to volume increases which result in revenue increases and it's likely ahead of what we planned, you're right. We talked about last quarter how we believe for the next couple of quarters it would be light. I will tell you, your comment's correct and I don't know that I could share and articulate the percentages of how the impact came from each sales, new sales leadership, new sales teams is definitely making an impact, right? That's a fair statement. The brand access wire is very strong in the market and the inbound activity that we're getting specifically inbound activity on very large accounts is now coming in at a rate that we've never seen before. So that's helping drive price as I highlighted in the call today. So the indicators are very good. The platform media suite things of what you mentioned is probably a smaller contribution compared to the others we just mentioned. I'd say that that's so early on in its evolution here that probably in the back half of the year that will have its next level of impact to us which will be even better from a volume perspective. Volume did grow, right? We said that we would like to get close to high teams percentages at the end of the year and into 20% next year. We're gonna exceed that. We're ahead of pace in what we're doing. We've had seen some industries slow down and other competitors and we're the benefactors of some of that winning some large accounts.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Okay, Guy, and then yeah, just touching on pricing there. I think you'd mentioned it was up 15% in the quarter. I was just wondering kind of the mix between is that selling into existing customers or is that mainly due to onboarding to these newer larger customers?","It's a combination. Yeah, new customer activity is definitely higher in price points. So we're able to take price where possible, right? We still wanna provide value to our client and we still wanna be perceived as the highest quality news wire with the best distribution at the best price. So we don't wanna sacrifice those initiatives. Although the pricing power of the current contracts in the last quarter were higher than prior quarters but we are seeing some benefactors of distribution add-ons and creativity and add-on services to our distribution to our customers that are now buying more broadly North America, Asia-Pac, Europe, and then targeted other regions of the world. So we're starting to see some of that happen as well.","The 15% increase in pricing is attributed to both higher price points from new customers and existing contracts, while the company aims to maintain value and quality in its services.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"And then just one more here, just on the comments about the compliance business and looking to sell that. Is that something you guys are in the process now? Is there interest out there from buyers? Are you guys, any sort of valuation metrics that you guys are hoping to get for it or are you kind of holding out till you get the right number? How are you thinking about the process of that?","Yeah, we've not begun a process, right? We've made a decision as a board that we need to move ahead with this. We obviously had to focus on getting the quarter done and behind us. We've got to unpack a lot of what the impact could be to the business, both from a discontinued operations kind of perspective from an accounting treatment, as I mentioned on the call, as well as what the process and how long would be to exit that business, what the shared services agreement would be to do it to sell to a buyer that will still need to be involved. And then ultimately what the valuation is, right? What is the market willing to pay? We're gonna canvas the market and we're gonna talk to a few key folks that we believe could have interest, whether we hire a banker or not, is undetermined at this stage, but it is a close community of people. So I think we should be relatively able to do this efficiently and quickly in less than a six month period. So the goal is to, if it has a market value of what we believe, that we should be able to end the year with a transaction being completed or before that.","The company has not yet started the process of selling its compliance business but has decided to move forward with it after completing the quarter.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"I was just curious if you could give an update for us on Amy, the AI content generation tool you launched, and if there's any metrics you could share on that product, that'd be great.","Yeah, Amy is a very good person. Currently in production with customers in two areas. One, as a press release drafting tool to enhance content, to write content however the customer so chooses. About 20% of our customers are using Amy actively to do so, which to be fair, in market statistics we're seeing from the competitors on our competitors' shopping, it's about average in the industry. There is a little bit of reluctancy in the PR firms to use some of the automated AI engine products. So look, I'm fine with that. I believe that something to grow on. Now the area that we do see Amy having its biggest opportunity is one, currently in production and two, I'll discuss with you something as a product roadmap idea, is that in the pitching product of our media suite, customers can take a pitch from Amy and send it to the journalist in our database by selecting key journalists and writers that they wanna reach out to their community or industry and let Amy automatically write and schedule and send the pitch to them. That is being used at a higher frequency than anything else from an AI tool perspective. And then the product roadmap idea is by the end of the year is to have Amy pre-write social posts for our customers based on the pressure ways to auto schedule them as a service add-on. So we're looking at introducing levels of our subscription product and that would be one area that our AI infrastructure will help drive revenue. And I say that to you only because it was clear at the very beginning of launch that Amy was a zero revenue driven technology initiative that we had, significant amount of cost, not much of which we capitalized to begin to roll it out. So we've got to now get utilization, get couple of patterns of use and interest and then start to exploit those opportunities to generate subscription revenue and that's what we're intending to do by the end of the year.","Amy, the AI content generation tool, is currently being used by about 20% of customers for drafting press releases, with a higher adoption rate for its pitching feature that allows users to send automated pitches to journalists.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Just wanted to touch, obviously, with the slowness in the press release distribution. If you could help us kind of quantify between AccessWire and NewsWire, just with AccessWire historically outperforming relative to Newswire, which has been kind of lacking. Just any sort of flavor for the trade-off between the two during the quarter.","Yeah. Hey, Luke. This is Brian. Look, I would tell you this is probably one of the first quarters we've seen AxisWire down on a year-over-year basis or a sequential basis in revenues. We have had a good run of nine-plus years of growth in the teens and 20s and beyond in that business. But as I alluded to in the call, there is likely a significant amount more headroom than we believed or even the market believed in the micro-nanocap space. The number of customers releases are likely about 50% down in those categories compared to other markets that we serve, including private companies. So that did impact AccessWire this period. Newswire also You know, conversely, is and continues to be down in its volumes. Its pricing power is strong. It is the top of the tier of the entire industry. When we compare pricing to PRN, PR Newswire, and others against Newswire, we are a premium brand pricing product there. We're holding price there, which is good. We're going to look to incentivize and reduce prices and include subscription products. testing there to see if we can spur volumes. But I will tell you that very late in the quarter and more recently now, we're starting to see volumes come back in both those categories. So we saw this happen a year and a half ago where volumes slowed down and then it picked right back up again the quarter after. And so the early indicators, we're seeing that already happening now.","The question inquired about the performance comparison between AccessWire and NewsWire, particularly in light of recent slowdowns in press release distribution. The answer indicated that AccessWire experienced a decline in revenue for the first time in years due to reduced customer releases in the micro-nanocap space, while NewsWire also faced volume decreases but maintained strong pricing power; however, there are signs of recovery in both services.",1,3,-0.499999875,0.181818174,3,3,0,0.27272726,0,2,-0.9999995,0.02247191,14,3,0.647058785,0.191011234,1,0,0,3,0,0
ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"And then just to go off of your comments on pricing there, I saw in the press release there was some mention of lower pricing during the quarter. Was that a function of some customers not being able to pay, or was that you guys lowering price to kind of pick up for the slower volume? Or kind of what were the puts and takes for the pricing coming in lower?","Yeah, I think it really is about being aggressive on price, is being aggressive in certain areas. industries that we are testing our API products that we firmly believe will expand thoroughly this year. And what that precisely means is that as you get to critical mass in news distribution, your fixed costs are then at a point of which you can enter into large volume contracts without incrementally hurting your gross margin very much. And so we're about halfway through that first interval. So it did impact gross margin slightly because we still got some low costs from editors and in that process, but we expect to clean the rest of that up in a development effort here at the end of the quarter where we'll be able to light on 20 to 30% more in volume and actually improve gross margins because we're able to reduce headcount entirely from touching those articles. So some of it's attributable to that. We're really working hard and believe that API integrations are a way to take even further market share. But, you know, look, at the end of the day, we want to walk prices up on our core customers, and that is, you know, the public company marketplace and, you know, the SMBs on the private side. So, we're trying to accomplish both at the same time. So, sometimes in combination, there's a little noise there, but we'll definitely, you know, talk about that a good deal in the future of how it looks between both.","The lower pricing during the quarter was primarily a strategic decision to be aggressive in certain industries and test API products, which slightly impacted gross margins.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,And then how are you guys kind of thinking of capital allocation as we go through 2024 via either investments into the business or buybacks or paying down some debts or kind of where is your guys' head at with capital allocation?,"Yeah, look, we've done a fantastic job of bringing MediaSuite to market quickly. We're going to continue to invest in some product categories. There's further AI attributions that we want to do for natural language translation processing on top of it. You know, so that's not going to change. You're going to see our R&D budgets, you know, kind of in line with what they've been the last few quarters. You know, but look, I'm going to tell you that overall, we're going to look at our expenses and really manage the business, but not sacrifice growth and investment in the organization. We've got to continue to do that as long as we feel confident in the market and what we're doing and our products and our customers. We've seen more enterprise deals come our way in the last, you know, call it 100 days of the year than we've seen, you know, in years past in combination. So we're building momentum there. And to be fair, the sales team that we brought in with years of experience is driving some of those opportunities. And that is important to us and what we're trying to accomplish, as you would well understand. And as everybody understands, the microcap space is not a growth market for us right now. That's just the reality of what we're dealing with. So on the flip side of it, you know, dividend likely not pay down debt, likely not, um, hold cash, right. And continue to execute, meet our covenants and accelerate the business is the optimum way to get through this year. And then that puts us into a good position next year to have a lot more options. And, and as Steve talked about, we generated almost another million dollars in cash this quarter. You know, we, we do this consecutively. I ironically think I was fact-checked at a conference last week that, uh, An investor said it's actually 36 quarters of consecutive cash flow from operations. So call it a quarter or not off. That's a trend that we're going to continue. So we want to accumulate that cash. But look, at the end of the day, if the markets we're serving aren't fulfilling what our estimates are and we have to use cash to do something with debt, we're prepared to do that. We're confident in what we need to run the business from a cash perspective. So we keep ourselves with a lot of options by holding on to that at this present time. You know, stock price is what it is. Execution is the key, right? We need to execute, and we clearly understand that, and we know what we need to do. But again, we accumulate more cash. That also could be an option for us in the future as well.","The company plans to maintain its investment in product development and R&D while managing expenses, focusing on cash accumulation rather than paying dividends or reducing debt.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Just wanted to touch a little deeper on the marketing strategy for the new media suite, just as far as that relates to acquiring new customers and then also getting existing customers to use the new product suite and then and how that kind of goes with I think last quarter you guys mentioned some sales hires too to help these efforts.","Yes. Hey, Luke. It's Brian. The media suite product began early marketing at the first week of the year, I think January 4th, right, the first day back from the holiday. Began direct campaigns to prospects in our database that are not customers of AccessWire or Newswire. Um, strategically we began targeting certain profiles of customers within our current install base, uh, with another series of marketing campaigns and videos, uh, teasing out something sweet was coming, right? That was the tagline of the, of the marketing platform campaign that they built. Obviously the suite ended up being media suite, um, to run the customers through a series of cadence of questions and what they're looking for ultimately to get to demo. to take the marketing qualified leads and build pipeline to a sales qualified lead. And they've been doing that successfully under both brands, both sales teams. To your latter point, you know, sales teams did grow. We retracted certain profiles of sales individuals in the organization and built a new enterprise style sales team, each one having approximately 10 years plus experience in the industry. It sold products like MediaSuite before. So we're doing it both from an experience sales direct sales channel end and then a marketing channel end to drive new inbound opportunities of both public and private customers looking for components of the media suite ultimately settling in on the full platform. We think the lead quantities are coming in at a relatively good clip. The demos and the pipeline is building as we expected it. So we're not seeing anything out of the norm today. So if you can start a product sale and generate hundreds of leads and qualify these folks and build pipelines that quickly, it should shape up to be a good product launch press this year.","The marketing strategy for the new media suite involves targeted campaigns to both new prospects and existing customers, aiming to generate leads and encourage product demos.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"How do you see this impacting gross margins going forward with the new suite and then the shift to recurring revenue model, are these going to be kind of in line with historical margins, or will we be seeing a shift over the years to come?","You know, I think you have to look at this short and long term. I think short term, as we start to begin to bring media suite customers into our install base and look at ARR, we likely won't see a significant impact to gross margins relative to the size it will contribute to overall revenue. Once it gets to that point near the year end and in the next year, we'll start to see gross margins climb in the communications segment of our business for obvious reasons that the product is an 80-plus percent gross margin product to deliver. So I think you just have to think about it in volume. Once it contributes enough to the revenue number, it will then have an impact to gross margin.","The impact on gross margins from the new suite and recurring revenue model will be minimal in the short term but is expected to improve significantly in the long term as the media suite customers contribute more to overall revenue, given its high gross margin potential.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"How should we be thinking about cadence of new product launches going forward. Is there anything you can quantify for us as far as maybe through 2024, any sort of flavor for what these, what to expect from new product launches?","Yeah, we're, you know, look, we've got a product team now that kind of sits right alongside of our development team that's matured significantly, you know, obviously with this kind of product launch and the level of effort, we've done a tremendous job there. So building a product team alongside of it, that's connected directly to sales feedback loops with marketing to really try to keep our ears to the ground and listen, right? We're not going to black box, build anything that we just think a customer wants. We're innovating features. Now that customer feedback is coming from, right? We want to do exactly what the customer wants, give them something that the competitive competitive landscape does not have. And so we're confident with Amy integrated into all these products and some of the ideas that, uh, we came away with over the last couple of days and workshops that we've done here on site are going to, we're going to iterate feature sets more than we're going to release new products. So we're really focused on taking a new entrant products, you know, the media suite product and innovating that against the competitive landscape with our customer feedback to get to a real premium product by the end of the year and into next year. And so that's going to be our focus. You know, that's not to say that we may not surprise everybody with a new product later in the year, but for today, that's what our development teams are focused on is to continue to iterate what we have right now.","The company plans to focus on iterating existing products based on customer feedback rather than launching many new products in 2024.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,I just wanted to ask about currently what you see in terms of the cash position right now. So you guys are at $5.7 million about. I just wanted to get your take on the potential for giving the current share price share buybacks this year.,"Yeah, we've been bullish on share buybacks in the past, right? We've done several million dollars of buybacks in our history. And, you know, from a return of capital, we've also done dividends to shareholders in the past as well and personally been active along with others in the management team and the directorship buying shares back. Look, I would tell you for today, we're likely going to continue to accumulate cash and invest in the business for growth. We will keep our eye on our share price as we should in the event that we do need to act to do something. But we want to keep, you know, covenants with bank obligations and capital needs of the business and investments all parallel together along with opportunistically looking at share buybacks.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Just wanted to touch quick on the new product pipeline, sort of how you see that playing out here into 2024. I know we'll probably get a better update on it next earnings call, but just trying to think of, of understanding. So is this going to be all of these products coming to market at once? And then it'll be kind of a, customers will get a pick and choose what they want to include in their bundle and that will affect their pricing or sort of kind of how, how this is being launched?","Yeah, it's a, Hey Luke, it's Brian. It's a great question. The, the, um, media suite product is going to be launched in three different variations. There'll be one that will include a media database and pitching solution. Um, that particular product suite, um, will sit around the entry points that we discussed earlier in today's call, and that will be focused on customers that are doing between three and 25 press releases currently with us today as a way to increase their annual spend and moving them more towards an ARR type of solution. The other options are going to be the media database pitching monitoring product along with a newsroom and their news distribution included in that. And so you maybe think about the latter two options being a basic and pro model or some sort of premium version that will scale up to the higher number we discussed of 18,000. And what that really means, the two differences of the latter two plans will be additional ways to pitch, additional press releases, more robust newsrooms, more customizations on the platform, assisted media targeting, compared to maybe more of another solution. So this product is perfectly aligned with the customers that would not be a candidate to buy a PR optimizer product from us, which are looking – those are the firms looking for us to build strategy, write content, calendaring, and do earned media outreach for them.

As we've talked about for the last couple of years, our news distribution business continues to grow and outpace the market and growth and percentage of market. But we are also only dealing with customers that can only buy press releases from us. And all the public companies tend to utilize our IR platforms and our earnings call platforms like we're doing on today's call.

Sort of how do you see that trending?,"Definitely, Mike. This is Brian. I'll answer that for you if you'd like. Look, like we talked about in the prepared remarks, there is an indicator here that we're seeing over the last few months that volumes are beginning to bounce back to normal levels with growth like we experienced last year in the prior years.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then what are sort of like the next steps we should watch or listen for with aiming your AI product? And if you could just also sort of address the cost side, maybe repeat what costs were capitalized and how you think about that investment going forward.","Yeah. So as a product summary, right, from a capitalization perspective, we wanted to build the product to a very mature MVP, right? Minimum viable product, get it to market to a segment of our clients. And what we're looking for now is to gather analytic upon the benefits of using AI written content compared to, you know, natural processing done by, you know, PR professionals and company professionals. So that's the indicator of getting 20% of our customers using it. They did releases in this measurement period, right? So the number of releases actually gives us comfort that there's going to be a baseline to sample against. And so what we'll look for is what were the benefits of engagement from articles written by Amy compared to not by industry and sector. so that we could break it out to provide customers a more premium level service. So at some point, we can then suggest to them, based on the tonality, if you make these changes, you could very well see an increased benefit in these industries and sectors, and here's how, and that's what you'll pay for. So that will be the paid version, if you want to think of it as a premium product. That's what that will be. Today, there is no cost for any, for customers. We capitalized about $160,000, $170,000 during the period. We've probably got about another 75 to 100 left here in this third quarter to complete that product. And the reason for the additional is because our developers were working late or just burning the midnight oil and figured out how to integrate Amy much quicker than we thought into our other products like we talked about today. So it will go into pitching next, giving our customers the ability to license and subscribe to the pitching product and media database. and then have a plug-in from Amy to be able to help them write or recommend a better way of their tonality to help their writing and engagement with media, journalists, shareholders, and everybody else.","The next steps for the AI product involve analyzing the benefits of AI-generated content versus traditional methods, aiming for 20% customer usage to establish a baseline for comparison.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"And maybe lastly, what are sort of early thoughts on monetization? I know it's early. I know it's not until 24, but how are you thinking about it?","Yeah, I'm looking at it in two ways. So we're going to go to market in Q4, and I don't want this to be a leading indicator that we're suggesting revenue here. We're going to go to market in Q4 to build a pipeline for a new subscription product that will be media database, analytics monitoring product, pitching product, newsroom, and news distribution, powered by Amy, all for one flat fee. But let's say it's $1,500 to $2,000 a month. we then believe that additional customers that don't subscribe will be able to take AMI and we can monetize it on a per-release basis. So if you sign up for your contracted press releases for U.S. National at $7.95 a release, you do 10 releases a year, you're pretty close to their average revenue per customer. We hope to then get another 10% to 15% to 20% lift on revenue in the customer by having them buy some of these add-ons. And we've done this successfully in the past because, remember, we used to sell – media targeting back very early on the access fire days. And we were able to get double digit, 20, 30% of our customers paying for upgrades on some of those things. And so that's where we can move those customers into the database product, which will mean more revenue for us. And we will look to then monetize Amy as a, as a, as a per unit benefit to the customer. And obviously to us.","The speaker outlines two monetization strategies for their upcoming subscription product launching in Q4, which will include a flat fee for a comprehensive media service and additional revenue from non-subscribing customers through per-release charges.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I mean, is that a sustainable number, you think? (referring to 31% adjusted EBITDA)","Well, I mean, Walter, first, thank you, right? And we talked about this in the last couple quarters, that we believe the full Synergy savings for our Newswire and AccessWire and IntraDirect combined entities would truly show through in 2.2. And look, to be fair, right, we live to that commitment, and the numbers printed are our illustration of that. It's a great question to suggest, you know, are you providing guidance to suggest that this is going to be your new baseline going forward? And look, I would tell you, absence of investments made, absence of one-time charges, or absence of something bad happening in the market, as long as our revenue continues to grow the way it has, we feel comfortable that we're going to be in the high-end 20s and then some quarters hit into the 30s. So it's an EBITDA machine. It's a cash flow machine. And it's all dependent on what I said in the call, right? Our number one focus is customers.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Brian, I just want to get a little bit of clarity. On the year-end call, you know, there was a little bit of industry-wide weakness with communications and AccessWire and Newswire seemed to be caught up in that. Are you saying now that's kind of past and you're back to growing again or less concerned about the industry? I guess just clarify us on what the updated commentary was.","Yeah, thanks, Mike. It's a good question. I would tell you, as we talked about just a couple of minutes ago, no doubt Q1 was up 21% standalone access wire, right? This core business that everyone is tracking. We're seeing volumes, as I slightly indicated, a little forward-looking, that volumes in the industry are continuing to climb. They're not yet climbed back to what the historical levels would be, but the indicator is they're beginning to show signs that they're coming back. Now, I would caution that in two ways. We're optimistic that they're going to continue to get better, and for several reasons for us. One is that we're still making wonderful headway against the incumbent, as we talked about, taking market share. So regardless whether the industry is growing by volume, we continue to grow, which is a good thing relative to our size, as well as taking price, as we talked about. But we are seeing volumes come back. We are seeing new customer entrants to the market. in the last call it 90 days that we probably didn't see late last year and early into this year. We're going to watch the financial markets. We're going to see how things progress there. That could be an impact to what may or may not happen in volumes. PR industry in general, historically, for as long as I've been in this industry, 17 years, you are susceptible to market corrections, does insinuate that volumes do go up and down a little bit. But the early indicator for us is it's bouncing back much quicker, which is a good thing to your point.","Brian indicated that while there was industry-wide weakness affecting AccessWire and Newswire, they have seen a 21% increase in Q1 and are optimistic about continued growth, with volumes starting to recover and new customers entering the market.

ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,And then is the best way for us to see the price that you're taking out there? I would refer to those ARPU numbers that you gave us for sort of 1Q23 versus 1Q22 and then 4Q. Could you repeat those numbers and maybe just clarify if that's a good indicator of the price you're taking in the market?,"Yeah, look, I think that subscription values, and this is a historical kind of conversation, right? It's not philosophical. It's just a historical conversation, is that typically for several years when we began the subscription business, we never were increasing price on renewal, right? We weren't and didn't have products, stable products, not stable as in consistency, but stable in the stable, right? Products in our product lineup, rather, that we were able to add to subscriptions to increase. We've done a good job on the subscription business, and that is press releases, IR websites, earnings calls, newsrooms, whistleblower services, and our compliance tools that have afforded us the ability to take some price there. That's one side. That's a good thing, and we believe we're going to continue to do that. That's the numbers we talked about in the call getting to $8,688 this Q1 compared to $7,016 in the Q2 the prior year. But what is more interesting to us is when we look at the average price of a press release. And we don't disclose this to the markets in general. So I'm going to be vague and look to do this in future quarters for everybody. But I would tell you that if we go back to, you know, kind of late 2021, we were likely sub $200 average press release prices. And as volume has increased steadily, so has price consistently. And so that number has grown significantly close to $300 now. And if We remove certain segments of the market. We are very close to $500 average price in the press release. And so that's very consistent with the Newswire theme of where they're at. And we feel like there's still room in the market. A lot of our investors have asked us, as you take price, is there still compression here? Could you see you being the more expensive solution? I would tell you that even at a $500 to $700 rate, we're still going to be right below by 10% to 15% of what everybody else is in the market. have plenty of margin opportunities to get aggressive should we need to if the markets force us to do that. So we're confident that we'll still take price on PR. We're confident that our subscription business will continue to grow as it relates to adding new products, as it relates to us reestablishing the market in a subscription way that will include PR and some of the new solutions that I talked about at the end of the call today.","The question inquires about the best way to assess pricing trends, referencing ARPU numbers from 1Q23 and 1Q22. The answer explains that while subscription prices have historically remained stable, recent increases in average press release prices—now approaching $300—indicate a positive trend, with the potential for further price adjustments in the future.",0,0,0,0,2,1,0.333333222,0.166666657,8,7,0.066666662,0.094936708,42,13,0.527272718,0.348101264,2,0,0,3,0,0
ACCESS Newswire Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"And just lastly, Brian, if there's one or two products that we should sort of be focused on the rest of this year, what would you highlight those as?","Yeah, it's interesting. We're going to sell the pitching and media database as a product together. So I wouldn't want to call them out individually because I think they go hand in hand. We have a firm belief that if you have a database to work for media professionals and journalists across the globe, you need to be able to have a communication outlet to them. And we feel like that communication needs to be done more in a non-traditional way than it's done in the market. Our competitors typically allow folks to pitch media via email, right? It's not very innovative, to be honest. And so we're developing ways that we can do it by desktop delivery, by using our events products that we built, right? We were really good pre-COVID times launching our event technologies and our virtual events products. including our webcast solutions, into it. So we feel like we can give marketers and PR professionals the ability to reach and pitch in a different way. So I think the combination of those will be important. A monitoring product is going to take time. You need media database and pitching customers in order for monitoring to really take hold. So that will likely come later, even though the product will be available this year. But I'm actually really excited about Amy. I think that an AI engine recommendation system is the evolution of where the PR industry is going. And we all need help writing good, unique content. We just want to do it in a very thoughtful way. So this recommendation engine will be available to customers free to begin with here in the next, call it 60 days. And then there'll be a subscription product that they'll be able to buy up into tonality scoring and research peer review. So in other words, I'm writing a press release. I want to compare it to my peers. Am I using the same acronyms as they are? Is something different? And what engagement are they getting compared to what I'm getting? And this recommendation engine has all that data set in it. So we're excited about that, what it could mean to a customer. We feel strongly that if we could make it easier for them to produce content to the world and tell their story in a magnified way, there may be a predisposition for them to do it more often. And there's some ease there. And so competitively, we're jumping ahead of what the market is doing and just using free solutions like ChatGPT. to find ways to be more creative there. So I'm excited about that product as well.","Brian highlights the importance of focusing on the combined pitching and media database product, which aims to innovate communication methods for media professionals.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Tom, just to go back to the reorg with merchant and banks and the shift to the GM model. If you could just expand on what the impetus was for both of those. And then just as we think about this year, what kind of tangible benefits we might start to see from those as we work through.","Yeah, sure, sure. So, if I go back to when I first walked in the door in November of 2022, we had an organizational structure that was functional and so there's nothing wrong with the functional organization. We got some efficiencies out of it. My challenge was I prefer and I think it just works better to have leadership teams that are as fully accountable for results in a in a entire business as possible. And so I've always I've always preferred to operate that way. I wanted to make sure that I got my arms around the ups and downs, the positives and the negatives of that with respect to API and I became very comfortable last year after seeing how successful we were on filler. We now roll it out across the company. And so what it means is Eric, the general manager of our payments software business. He now has the sales resources, the account management resources, the implementation team, the product marketing teams. They all are working on the same team. And so we've already started to see benefits from consistency of direction from, you know, no matter how good everybody is at at working across them matrix. If you're if you have different bosses, it's challenging. And so now every person in the company that's supporting directly our bank and merchant customers. They all report to the same team. And they are very clear on what their objectives are. And they they're actually they're thrilled that we've done this because it just it just helps everybody get on board with what we're trying to do. So that's that's why we did this. We're highly confident that it's going to have very positive results. I think what we'll what we'll see. And and I'll we'll keep you updated on this and how it's really going.

They don't have to think twice about who is accountable for their business inside of ACI. In the past, we had times where a customer would say, well, if it's if it's implementation, I need to call Jane. If it's, you know, if it's a new opportunity, a sales thing, I need to call Joe.

They don't go away on day one, but we're starting already to see benefits.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"For Scott, just anything more specific on and I guess now we're down to two segments, but on what the growth expectations are at the segment level between the new payment software and biller and then just as we think of the and I know banks is now wrapped with merchant, but just relative to twenty four contribution you guys are expecting from new sales. And then also any impact we should think about from renewal volume if there's any cadence in twenty five to be mindful of.","Yeah, first item, you know, last year, we laid out kind of the long term targets by each of the three segments. They were all over the three year time rise and call it high single digit revenue growth. That won't change. Ultimately, I think there was opportunity upside opportunity in banks. If you get traction on the payment hub with the tier two banks that could push banks up to double digits, but because merchants relatively small, it's a part of the payment software business. It's really not going to really not going to change the trajectory of those numbers. They were pretty much all in line. So, I would stick with those those growth numbers. I think externally what you guys will see starting with you one is really a combination of bank. What is this sort within banking merchant? So, if you're modeling, you know, kind of the go forward, it's really combining those two, those two business segments into one. It's really not going to be any more complicated than that. And as it relates to this year's new business. And renewal business renewal book is again, I think that every year, it's calling 20% plus or minus of the total books. So nothing really significant there in terms of sizing the new business. You know, as I said, I'm a call we are making a conscious effort to kind of the risk full year, make it so that we don't have to rely so much on the fourth quarter. And that's why I said, I'm not prepared remarks that you're going to see more. Or more of the full year revenue in the first half than we saw in 2024 and hopefully that'll be a trend going forward that we begin to balance out the year. So last year, 2024 had 43% the first half issues can be 45%. You know, it doesn't seem like a big shift, but again, it's going to take time to just to balance out the year and get rid of some of that.   Yeah, and I think this is obvious, but the reason that it takes some time to really make an impact there is, as we say all the time, these renewals deal, it doesn't matter when we sign them. They're recognized on the middle date. And so we're still doing a really good job. Teams doing a really good job of signing these renewals earlier. That doesn't move the needle. But where we have the leverage is on the new business. And that's why you're seeing a very strong key one because Because this is a great thing for the company. It's great for our shareholders. They don't have to worry so much about Q4 and frankly, I don't have to worry so much about Q4 getting it all done. So it's good news all the way around.

And ACI, given our history and the long relationships we have with most of these financial institutions, were a natural choice. I think historically, we have probably spent most of the time with our customers on renewals, you know, talking about, hey, five years from now, we need to talk about a renewal. Well, now we're talking to them consistently throughout the year, throughout the five-year period of the license, and we're talking about the future. And as we've as we've begun to ramp up discussions around the payments hub, that's even building on this. And so now, I mean, I heard from a very, very large Asia Pacific customer. I was in Asia, as I mentioned earlier. I was in Asia recently, and I was talking to this customer, and they said, ACI is showing up differently. We're having these conversations about how you can help us achieve our objectives, Your products are critical to what we do. That's always been the case. It continues to be the case. But they feel like we are much more of a partner. So that's a lot of words, Trevor, but I think we have a really important role with these customers. We are continuing to exercise some pricing power that we have, we've always had. But I think most importantly, we are being perceived as a partner and we're talking about how we help them achieve their objectives. And they're much more, I'm not gonna say they're happy about paying more and about continuing to do more business with us, but they're comfortable with that because they see us as part of the solution to their future.","The question seeks insights on the medium-term growth outlook for banks, focusing on structural changes and market dynamics.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Just when you guys are talking about having almost all of this year's renewals either contracted or signed, and then you're shifting focus to 2025, aside from just giving us better visibility into what revenue looks like over the next year or two, is there anything else strategically that that enables when you get more of the renewal activity done earlier in the year, whether that's freeing up more sales focus for cross-sell and up-sell, just how we should think about that kind of strategic impact and how that can have an impact on the growth algo for banks. Thanks.","Yeah, so I'll make a comment, and then Scott may have a thought on this too, but I think there are two main benefits. One is, and you just said it, we We have almost no discussion. In fact, I don't expect Scott and myself to have a single conversation about a renewal for the remainder of this year. We're talking about how do we help our sales and account management team structure new business in 2025 and beyond. That's all we're talking about now. So, whereas normally we spend quite a bit of time thinking about how do we answer customer questions? How do we get these renewals signed up? We don't have to do that at all. So we're focused on the pipeline and setting up Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 of next year. So that's probably the biggest thing. The second thing though is I mentioned the payments hub and we've made great progress on that. We're very close to having solution that we can start to actually demonstrate to our customers. And now what I'm spending most of my time on right now is sitting down with customers and potential customers and giving them much more insight into what that payments hub looks like, what the benefits they're going to get will be. And I think I was, you know, I tried to be a little bit funny. Our beta client, we have so many customers asking to be early adopters, you obviously can't have them all. You have to narrow the list. So on the one hand, it's allowed us really to focus on next year, which we are. And on the other hand, it's allowed me in particular, but our sales team as a whole, to focus on helping customers understand where we're going and how they can leverage the investments that we're making.  Yeah, Trevor, the only thing I'd add to that, you know, I've been around a long time and the ACI has a history of, well, first of all, the bank, especially in the bank side, it's a long sales cycle. And we have a history of that sales cycle coming to fruition in the fourth quarter and late in the fourth quarter. And I think what you see here is 2 things 1 is we have substantially completed this year's new business really the end of September. I mean, it's not now in November. It was, it was really earlier in the year and that allows us to turn the focus to accelerate. that pipeline. Again, a pipeline that otherwise may have, you know, came to fruition the fourth quarter of next year is now maybe pushed to the third quarter of next year and potentially earlier. So, what it really frees us up to do, like Tom said, is listen, we can accelerate it, spend time accelerating next year's pipeline. And what that allows us to do, not just for 25 to 26, that allows us to continue on the path, you know, towards our long-term stated growth goals.","The discussion highlights the strategic benefits of completing this year's renewals early, allowing the team to focus on developing new business for 2025 and beyond, rather than spending time on renewals.

When you provided the medium-term guidance back in March, that was under different leadership here in the U.S. Maybe tell us what some of your initial reactions are here. It seems like perhaps regulation, taxation, other things could potentially be shifting a little more positively. And many of us saw the banking sector was up a lot in the market yesterday, particularly many of the larger G-SIBs. And clearly that's an important customer segment for you guys. So could you help frame this? Perhaps it might increase the pipeline or could see more transaction growth, things like that.

No, sorry, just trying to be funny.

We certainly hope that there's maybe a little bit less regulation in the U.S. Hopefully we see a little more transaction growth, as you said, That would all be upside for us, but we haven't obviously built any of that into our forecast because it's so new and we just don't have a handle on it yet.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Tom, it was good to hear the interest you're seeing from potential customers in the payments hub. How would you characterize your opportunity here internationally relative to the U.S. market and the time to market here? Also, how are you prioritizing your investments in this regard?","Sure. Thanks. So we see opportunity around the world. And I think that's probably no surprise. Where we're seeing the most interest right at the moment is I would say it's Asia Pacific one. I gave a specific example there. And one of the reasons for that is some of our competitors are removing competitive products from support. And that's always a good opportunity for us, but especially right now. So that's the driver there. But the biggest, probably the largest source of interest is coming from Europe. And I may have said this on an earlier call, I don't remember, but the big driver there, one of the big drivers, is that the European Central Bank has mandated faster payments, instant payments, it's called different things in different countries, but real-time payments. What's happening is these chief information officers are realizing that they have some concerns about their overall payment infrastructure being able to keep up with the expected pretty dramatic increases in volumes because a lot of that instant payments is cannibalizing cash transactions. Cash transactions have a very small impact. on financial institutions, technical infrastructure, but they're moving to digital payments, and that obviously does have an impact. So there's a lot of interest in figuring out what do they need to do, what are the opportunities for their payments infrastructure generally, and when we talk about the payments hub, That gets them very excited. So, I gave you an example where somebody literally jumped out of their chair. That was an Asia Pacific example, but I've had similar conversations in Europe. So, just to sum that up, interest around the world, in particular, we're having lots of conversations in Europe and Asia Pacific right now.","Tom highlights significant international interest in their payments hub, particularly from Europe and Asia Pacific, driven by competitors withdrawing support for certain products and the European Central Bank's push for faster payments.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Relative to maybe, you know, three months ago when we had the Q1 call, can you speak to your pipeline across the three segments as we look to the second half and 2025, both from a renewal and new business perspective?","Sure. I'll make a comment, and I know Scott's raring to go on answering this question as well. So, our pipelines continue to grow, and you asked about renewal and net new. So, the net new pipeline continues to grow. Obviously, we understand the renewal pipeline extremely well, because we've known for five years what was going to renew this year. So, no surprises there. I think the good news, I'm sure everybody was excited about what I said a moment ago, I'm going to call it pre-sold. That's not quite the right term, but we signed early $100 million plus of renewals. We signed them in the first half of the year, but they won't be recognized in the second half. So, as I said, that significantly de-risks what we're expecting in the second half. It makes us even more confident. And it's, again, a reason that we're comfortable increasing our guidance range. But the pipeline, so renewal pipeline is what it is. We do sometimes get a little more than we expect from a renewal, or than we build into the plan, I guess I should call it. Because we sell an additional service, or we sell additional capacity. There are various reasons for that. But we understand that pipeline very well. The net new, that pipeline is growing very nicely. And we expect it to continue to grow. And that's two reasons for that. One is just our position in the market and the reliability, scalability, dependability of our solutions. And number two is this, all of the dialogue we're having around payments help.  Yeah, and the only other thing I'd add to that is I think it goes back to what Tom said about our focus in the first half on getting renewal done. So what I'm excited about in terms of our pipeline progression is we're getting the renewals out of the way now. So in the first half of the year, focus is turning now to closing out the key license We want to get those done here before the end of K-3, and then we can really start progressing further the 2025 pipeline. So, I think everything is lining up so that we are not only, you know, tracking to deliver on what we're expecting this year and actually raising the guidance to deliver a bit more, but allow us to progress the 2025 pipeline as well.","The speaker reports that their pipeline is growing for both renewals and new business, with significant early renewals already signed, which boosts confidence for the second half of the year and allows for an increase in guidance.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"In terms of, could you give a little bit of your thoughts or your outlook based on, you know, I'm sure you have very good insight into this, but over the next two years, you know, how you see real-time payments evolving, you know, any major countries or regions planning major upgrades or adoption, and then as well, in terms of the your comment on the European Union or European Commission mandating some real-time payment. Are they mandating all banks within a country, or is it actually cross-border within the whole EU that covers that mandate?","Yeah. So let me take that first one first, Steve. That's a mandate to accept real-time payments and that's different called different things in different countries and that that is clearly progressing toward cross-order but uh honestly it's not it's not very well developed at the moment anywhere in the world cross-orders um because there's a lot of implications on the regulatory environment so it'll happen i think that's going to be much slower than the initial acceptance but the specifically european central bank has said every financial institution must be able to accept and process real-time payments across the EU. So we're obviously, we've been prepared to support financial institutions doing that for some time, but it's creating, that's interesting, but actually that's not why it gets me excited, because why it gets me excited is what I mentioned a minute ago, which is that is driving an entirely different conversation about the overall payment infrastructure and the need to upgrade because our solutions, you know, our customers don't worry about being able to support these very high volumes. They know that our solutions can, but some of the other pieces of their infrastructure, they're not so sure. So that creates a really interesting dialogue and that's where the payments comes in. Then you asked also about, are there any countries where we expect to see major, I guess, pushes maybe for real-time payments. And there are some countries that have no infrastructure. They tend to be a little bit smaller. But the larger countries, they now typically have a real-time payment scheme, or maybe even more than one, like the United States has two now. We support both. But just one example, and we did a press release, I think, on this a while ago, that Columbia, So Columbia is a very important market for us. It's one of the largest economies in South America. And we support that real-time payment scheme as it's maturing. And so I expect to see increased volumes over the next couple of years from that program and others. But I think what we're going to see mostly is just the maturing of of the real-time payment ecosystem, we'll see increased volumes everywhere. That would be my expectation. And then we will see cross-border become a bigger thing. And that's when, you know, some of the use cases become super interesting once that starts to happen. But that's dependent on regulation. And I don't even try to predict that.","The speaker discusses the evolving landscape of real-time payments, highlighting that the European Central Bank mandates all financial institutions in the EU to accept real-time payments, though cross-border capabilities are still underdeveloped.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,Your third quarter guidance so very very strong revenue and EBITDA guidance and and I infer that that suggests that you you have insight into another strong license fee rev rec quarter.

But you're right in terms of the license timing, and it's really more of a function of the banks than it is the merchant side of the business.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,I was hoping you could drill down in the banking segment. Can you talk about the growth you're seeing right now in real-time payments? It was 28%. Which markets are you seeing the most demand? Maybe tell us a bit more about that. And then how sustainable do you think growth in real-time payments could be for you guys? I'd say about 20%. I just want to get a feel for sustainability of a strong growth as you look ahead.,"I'll take that, Tom. Maybe you can add to it. I mean, yeah, real-time payment in the bank statement has been one of our fastest growing for years. And most of that growth is really coming from outside the U.S. And, again, that's where we have, you know, regulatory mandates. that require the implementation of real-time systems. So that's a situation where regulation actually helps us. But I would expect that level of growth to be sustained and, again, predominantly driven by outside the U.S. You know, we do have the Fed now live in the U.S., but we're not really at this point projecting when we're going to see real critical mass on the U.S. side. So, again, double-digit growth will continue, and most of it from the international market.  Yeah, Jeff, I'll just add, I mentioned the prime time for real-time report. We had a press release go out this morning, so you can get access to that easily. Just a couple of numbers from there that lead us to believe this is highly sustainable. In fact, the headline from the press release is that the growth in real-time payments is sustainable. That is the headline. And if you look at what happened in 2023, there were 266 billion real-time payment transactions around the globe. And our forecast is that by 2028, there'll be 575 billion. So that's a compound annual growth rate of about 16.7%. And that's with pretty conservative estimates of what happens in the U.S. because it's pretty unclear how quickly that's going to happen.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"And then on your guidance, the four-year guidance, can you walk us through the raise? Is it fair to say that the increased expectations for the revenue line are coming from the banking segment? Or maybe just how would you break that off for us? How should we be thinking about the raise and the four-year guide for revenue?","Yeah, I would say the higher expectations are coming in part from banks, but we're also seeing pretty strong growth in our biller business. And so we look at the outperformance in Q1. A little of it came from new license sales in the quarter and services, which are predominantly banks, but part of that can be a timing in year. where we really outperformed our own expectations was in our SaaS transaction-based part of the business. That really is what gives us comfort. That's a part of that recurring base of revenue that is carried into Q2. Some of the license and service can be timely, but the SaaS transaction-based is where we saw the higher growth in Q1 and expect that to continue here in Q2. you know, coming in at the high end of our guidance for the quarter, really, I think our raise is kind of an acknowledgement that we're starting the year better than we expected, both top line and bottom line.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"I thought the particularly gaudy high growth number came from issuing and acquiring this quarter.

And we're not, certainly that's a more mature segment for you. And to see that kind of growth was very impressive. So I just wanted to understand the sustainability of that.","Yeah, part of that, George, on the license side is dependent upon the timing of renewals year over year. But that's where I'm saying even over and above that, we did overachieve on the bank license side. And that would have been on new sales, overachieved on the services side. And again, both of those can be a bit of timing.

I'm intrigued to sort of understand that movement.","Yeah, sure. So that's exactly what's happening. So we are seeing SAS, as Scott just mentioned, we saw overperformance from our expectations on the SAS side, across the board, really. and obviously in banking as well. And that's actually creating a pretty nice environment for these conversations about the payment hub because the customers are taking advantage of the services that we're providing and we're doing a good job for them. And so that's creating a real, probably an even stronger willingness than I was expecting to talk about what's coming in the future because as they're growing, they're looking to make sure that they can take advantage of the scalability and reliability that we've provided the big banks for a very long time. So they're kind of feeding each other in a way.

And so the more success we have there, obviously the higher percentage of our overall total revenue will shift to SAS. Yeah, Trevor, on the banking in particular, we will continue to see a shift to more SAS that The thing that we look at is such a large percentage of our bank revenue is licensed. It's going to take a while. I don't know exactly, but it's not going to be a quick transition to the bulk of the revenue being SAS, but we will continue to see an increasing percentage.","The question inquires about the potential shift from licensing to SaaS revenue in the banking segment, particularly in the mid-market.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to see if you could give a little bit more color or interpretation on your bookings numbers. You're getting both ARR and licenses and services bookings. And when we look at those, certainly down year over year on the ARR side, following a relatively stronger year in 2022, how should we interpret the ARR bookings and now the license and service bookings in terms of incorporating in that, that in the model? I mean, historically with the total bookings, you know, directionally that had some value, the ARR bookings that having a harder time kind of extrapolating that into when do those start to have an impact and how concerned should we be with or with the down bookings for the year?","Yeah, thanks Pete. This is Scott. We've talked about this now for a number of quarters. The one aspect of the ARR metric is it doesn't really capture the booking success that we have in the bank business, which is predominantly on premise. And so we've been talking about our license and service sales. We put that into the bookings table this quarter. That is up, whether you're looking at the quarter over quarter, year over year, is up in the 16% to 17% range. And that's really where we've been seeing our success. So it's more of a function of which segment we're seeing success in bookings in 2023, and that's coming from banks. Really, if you look at banks over the last three years in terms of revenue growth, it's been coming out of COVID, if you exclude Dragonfly, our digital banking sale, revenue to the banks has been really our strongest segment. It's been up 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis. And so we're continuing to see that strong bookings growth in the bank segment in license and services in 23. The only other thing I'd point out is if you recall in 2022 on the ARR side, we did have our largest biller deal that we've ever sold, was in the 2022 comps. And that sort of deal size did not recur in 2023.","The question seeks clarification on declining ARR bookings and their implications for the business model, particularly in light of stronger license and service bookings.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then in terms of interchange, you had said in the press release that you do expect net adjusted EBITDA margins for the year to expand a bit. So would that imply that interchange is maybe going to grow at about the same rate or maybe even a little bit faster than total revenue?","I would say generally in line with. I think we still have some room for improvement there. Obviously, we had a big improvement between 22 and 23 in terms of all the initiatives that we've put in place. But there's still more to go.

And maybe explain how you're thinking about revenue growth by segment. Can you break that out for us? And then specifically on your banking segment, what opportunities are you seeing there right now with clients? Maybe give us some flavor for what we should expect to see there in 2024 and maybe tell us about your pipeline.","Yeah. On the 2024 growth, I think if you look at relative to 2023, the biller segment grew 9% in 2023, but that growth really was a function of three things. One is just your same-store sales growth. Second is the go-live and ramping of net new client business. And the third piece was some of the repricing elements of dealing with the interchanges we had in 2022. So you go to 2024, two of those three elements are still going to be there. There may be some repricing element left, Billers should fall back into, call it that, within the 7% to 9% growth rate that we're talking about in terms of total company. The bank business, which in the last three years, CAGR has been about 8% plus. 2024 will kind of look like it'll be back to kind of mean reversion. This year was only a couple, 2% or 3%, but next year will kind of three-year average. And then merchant, which was a drag essentially on growth in 2023, as we talked about, exited the year stronger. And that exit rate will carry into next year, would expect the merchant business really to be at the high end of our consolidated growth rate. So they all line up pretty much within that 7% to 9% growth, but a little bit different dynamics by each of the segments.  Yeah, and then on the, I think your question was about banks, the bank segment and opportunities and pipeline. So, we're seeing a number of different types of opportunities and it depends on which region of the world you're in, but I'll give you kind of a flavor for it. So, we continue to see price increases as we renew with our existing customers. And those are based primarily on two things, volumes. So they need to buy more capacity from us than they did the last time. And then price increases related to the inflation that has happened between the last renewal and this one. So that's one driver. And that's in our more developed markets. And then we look at places like Latin America and Asia, and we see new opportunities with financial institutions and those are are many of those are driven by what I mentioned in my comments earlier the understanding that real-time payments volumes are coming and that it depends on which country you're in whether whether these financial institutions have seen those volumes ramp yet or not and but everyone knows they're coming and they're thinking about how do i make sure that my payments infrastructure can handle that increase of volume because these are to a large extent those real-time payments are are cannibalizing cash transactions and so those you know a bank in a bank in latin america doesn't not a lot they have to do with the cash transaction but that but as it moves to real-time payments that changes and they need to make sure they're ready for the for the volume and they're they're making sure that they are they're trying to make sure they are and that's when that opportunity comes for us to talk to them they want to continue to take advantage of our proven scalability reliability and then so if they don't have it they're they're looking to talk to us about it if they do already have some of our software they're they're asking for our help to make sure the rest of their infrastructure can handle that increased volume so Those are some flavors of it. The pipeline is very strong. It's growing, and that dynamic about being ready for the ramp and volume that they know is coming eventually, that's one of the key drivers.","The company anticipates a revenue growth of 7-9% in 2024, driven by factors like same-store sales growth and new client business, with the banking segment expected to revert to its historical growth rate after a dip.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"My follow-up on that, on real-time payments, is one of the biggest questions we've been getting inbound about your opportunity is there's so much focus on FedNow but my understanding is for your footprint, it's much broader than that globally. So would you mind, I don't want to preempt your analyst day, too much here, but today, but would you mind mapping out where you see the most significant opportunities for real-time payments? Is it Europe, is it Asia, Latin America, et cetera? How would you characterize that?","Well, I don't, I'm not trying to be flippant on this, but it's all of the above because, and where I think you, probably know this, but just so we're all on the same page, largest real-time payment markets today in the world are India, that's the largest by far, Brazil, and China. Those are the three largest real-time payment markets in the world. And the rest of the world is, to some extent, playing catch-up, but the European Central Bank has mandated the availability and support of real-time payments across the Eurozone. So you've got and you have real-time payments in Europe, of course, but that is it's getting a lot more attention and then Latin America is is an up-and-comer outside of Brazil It's still a relatively small volumes with real-time payments, but that's changing and I mentioned we signed the central bank of Colombia in terms of supporting the their their real-time payments central infrastructure and That's just one example in Latin America, but I think that you will continue to see significant growth in the focus on and volumes of real-time payments in Latin America, also in Asia, and certainly in Europe. So lots of opportunity. You mentioned FedNow. I mean, FedNow is still a new thing. It's only a few months in, and the Fed has not published specific volumes yet. But we expected them to be pretty small at the beginning, and they are. But we're getting new institutions signing on at an increasing rate. And I don't have the exact number from the Fed in front of me, but, you know, the number of institutions has grown a lot since that started. And what's really interesting, too, is the clearinghouse's real-time payments transactions have benefited from all the marketing that the Fed's done around FedNow. So we are starting to see increased volumes. I think it's going to continue to take a while before the volumes are extremely large. But again, to me, the most interesting thing is the discussions that the anticipation of real-time payment volume increase is generating for us. And that's That's really good for us. It puts us in a position to help our customers deal with one of the biggest issues they're wrestling with right now.  Yeah, the only other thing I'd add to that is just in terms of a metric, our real-time payments solution revenue growth in 2023 was 23% over 2022. And very little of that, if any, right now is coming from FedNow. So there's really no – there's not a real contingency on our 202","The question inquires about the global opportunities for real-time payments beyond FedNow, while the answer highlights that significant markets include India, Brazil, and China, with growing potential in Europe and Latin America.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Can you point more to some of the dynamics that give you confidence in 7% to 9% growth in 2024, given that there have been a little bit relatively soft ARR bookings here today?","I would turn back to the comments I made in my prepared remarks. Really, if you look at the underlying recurring revenue of the business, that's going to be the base layer of next year's revenue. That is up 8% year-to-date, getting stronger here in the second half, 10% in Q3. So that's really the base rate of revenue growth we have going into next year. And then just the overall visibility, especially on the bank side, the renewal book for next year, and then the third layer would be net new business. So, what's the maturity of the pipeline? So, on the bank side in a part of the merchant business, it's really less about the ARR bookings and more about the license and services sales. But again, it's the install base, the recurring revenue growth that we're seeing that really carries us in and gives us confidence in next year.   Yeah, and I'll just add one thing, Ali, and Scott alluded to it, but the ARR bookings that we've had over the last 12 to 18 months is what is going to drive the increase in revenue next year.

Were there any dynamics in the period that you might consider one time or do you view this level of growth as sustainable in the near term future?,"Yeah, no, I think, especially if you look at the comp, you know, last year Q3 was the quarter where we really saw the issues with the interchange impacted by some of the inflation in the utility segment, you know, jump to this year. And we've gone through, you know, about 12 plus months of improvement programs, various initiatives, whether it's repricing, or the overall cost to get the interchange down. So I think what you're seeing in that, the net revenue growing faster than gross revenue in Biller is a function of all those initiatives that we've had. And so we continue to have more initiatives. We continue to monitor that. But I think what that's showing in the actual results is the success of what we've done here over the last 12 months.","The increase in biller revenue this quarter is attributed to successful initiatives over the past year, particularly in response to previous challenges in the interchange due to inflation.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Tom, you touched on the incremental market in the bank segment that you're going after. Maybe touch on some of the more immediate opportunities there. What are some of the areas of investments? And when can we expect to see the impact on the P&L?","Yeah, sure. So I was talking about the – we tend to call it the mid-tier financial institutions, and that's probably not quite the right terminology because historically ACI has had tremendous success And we enjoy a strong market presence in the mega banks, the very, very large banks, over $250 billion in assets around the world. And we continue to have that. We continue to grow there. But what I was talking about is just slightly smaller. So I'm not talking about small financial institutions by any means. I'm talking about the tier that goes from roughly $50 billion to $250 billion. So these are still massive institutions. But what we're seeing is, that those institutions are equally interested in what we can provide. They want the very high reliability. They want the proven capabilities, the ability to scale. They want all that. But those institutions tend to be more open to or interested in a SaaS delivery model and or a cloud delivery model. And so that's where we're seeing even more demand that we believe we can do an even better job of fulfilling over the coming years. And so it's the same types of offerings. We've already made a lot of investment there. We can deliver virtually all of our products using cloud tools and technologies and infrastructures today. And we continue to make investments to make them work even better. and to make them work a little bit better for that next tier down. But we're going to continue to do that. It's part of the modernization journey that we've talked about for a long time. But we're just seeing – the point I was trying to make was that those investments, they're already yielding results because that is one of the places that the recurring revenue strength is coming from, is that tier.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,And any comment on the performance of your real-time payment business in Q3 and anything to add on the outlook for next year there?,"Sure, sure. I mean, we're continuing to see growth in every region in real-time payments. Its volumes are strong. I know that a lot of people are interested, and I'm interested, frankly, in FedNow volumes because obviously there's been a lot of marketing done. And at the recent CYBOS conference in Toronto, there was tons of discussion. That was shortly after the launch of FedNow. The Fed's done an excellent job of marketing. But as expected, and I think I said this on the last call, As expected, volumes in FedNow are very low. And that is not a surprise. No one expected them to ramp real quickly. So no surprise at all. But what we are seeing is a significant pipeline of financial institutions that are coming on board to be ready to handle FedNow transactions. So we have over 100 institutions financial institutions that already are able to participate in the FedNow through using our tools. And there are hundreds more that are in the pipeline through directly with us and with partners that use our technology. So that's the U.S. side volumes on FedNow relatively low. We have seen an increase in the clearinghouse RTP utilizations. And I think that's largely due to the the the attention that's been drawn to real-time payments generally because of the Fed Fed marketing and And that's great, but still relatively small volumes in the u.s But other parts of the world are seeing much more significant growth and we expect that to continue","The real-time payment business is experiencing growth across all regions, with strong volumes, although FedNow's transaction volumes remain low as expected following its recent launch.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"As we think about the go-forward run rate for Biller, could you talk about the degree to which the outperformance relative to the 7% and 9% target this quarter was driven by easier comps versus the layering on of new deals and incremental recurring revenue? And if you know, maybe an accelerated pace of onboarding could lead to either outperformance or performance towards the higher end, that 7% to 9% target going forward?","I don't think – when I referred to the comps on the earlier question, it really wasn't about the top-line growth of the biller business. That came in at 11%. in the quarter. It was more around the interchange improvement. So, if you look at a net of interchange, it accelerated, and that was off of a tough comp last year because we had a lot higher interchange impact. So, I would say the business isn't going to continue to grow at an 11% rate. I would look at it more in the upper single digits going forward. So, we did have a large customer go live here in 2023, but that customer is not fully ramped. That should fully ramp in early 2024. So that's really, when we look at 2024, that's a part of our comfort in the 7% to 9% in total is business that we've already sold and it's either live and ramping or will go live in relatively short order. So when we look at it, and that's not just Biller, it's across the whole business, is It's really business that's already sold in live or business that's sold in ramping.

It's not what I call incremental to our run rate of spend. It's a reprioritization of what we are spending, and it's going to be targeted – predominantly towards the bank segment, kind of the tier that Tom's talking about in developing payment hub capabilities, where we're seeing a lot of demand, not just in that next tier of banks, but also our global install base is looking for hub capabilities. And so it's going to be predominantly in the bank segment hub capabilities, and you're not going to see a significant increase in expense versus our current run rate.

You've probably heard me say those words a couple of times. And the industry tends to talk about it as a payments hub and how do we help our clients manage all varieties of payments, ensure that they are handled with scalability, reliability, that they have the ability to route them correctly, process them very efficiently, offer new services. And ACI is, of course, extremely well positioned to take advantage of that across the industry because of the installed base we have, the reputation that we have, and the absolutely proven nature of our software product. So we're clearly well positioned, but that is – by our estimation, the fastest growing portion of the banking business, banking payments software business worldwide.

And we kind of had signaled that when we came out of our first quarter call. that we'd be about, you know, we were negative first quarter. Second quarter was about flat, slightly positive in terms of dollars, and that we would exit the year in kind of that mid-to-upper single digits growth.

Thanks, Joseph. I appreciate all those comments. So as I've said a few times, and I definitely want to reiterate that I think ACI's strategy is solid. And I think the team is solid. I think the business model is solid. So you shouldn't expect to see major shifts anytime soon because we just don't need them. But what I am focused on is making sure that we are concentrating our investments and efforts in areas that are going to deliver results as fast as possible. So one example, of course, being what we've been talking about in our biller segment, we had some challenges but big opportunities, and we've been laser-focused. We brought in new leaders for that space, and it's really performing well. So there's one example. But you're getting back to your actual question.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to focus specifically on Biller. Obviously, there's been a platform change. You had recent wins of some good size. You mentioned that you had another large win post quarter.

But you're right. I mean, we have had, you know, success. What we haven't seen yet this year is some of the impact of some of the bigger go-lives that we're going to see here in the second half on deals we sold last year. So, you know, I think the upside in Miller is kind of yet to come in terms of the performance. And, again, that stuff we sold last year is going live here in the second half. The one that Tom mentioned that signed here the 1st of July will probably more likely impact us as we get into the second half of next year. But again, in terms of publishing win rates, we don't have those statistics to provide. We do think we're taking share, though. We're gaining share. We are winning deals that we needed to win. And as Scott mentioned, we really haven't seen the bulk of the impact from those larger deals quite yet. The really big one we've been talking about, it is live, but it is not completely cut over.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"So, it was good to see biller revenue net of interchange up about 7% year over year. Based on some of the new customer wins that you've talked about, do you think that for the full year that you can achieve that high single-digit growth goal within Biller Net of Interchange?","Yeah, Pete, this is Scott. Yeah, no, we're really happy with it too, I think, for a number of reasons. One is we're starting to see the benefit both at gross revenue and net revenue and profitability in the biller business. We're seeing the benefits of the interchange program initiatives that we've put in place that combined with the go lives that we saw from late last year. So we're going to get a full year benefit of those go lives this year. So we're real happy with, we believe billers really kind of turned the corner in terms of both growth rate as well as we're starting to see the interchange initiatives that we put in place. should start to see sequential benefit as well as comparable benefit on the interchange as a percentage of the gross revenue there. So definitely benefit both sides, both from go-lives as well as the interchange improvement initiatives taking hold.   Yeah, just to add one thing.

So FedNow goes live in July, and we've been involved with the Fed as they've been plotting this launch for some time. We're in the final stages of testing and we're in very good shape for the go-live for our customers and we've got a pretty good pipeline as well of new opportunities driven by our position with FedNow. That's where we are. We should, you know, obviously no volumes at this point because it hasn't launched, but we should start to see them immediately after the launch. And I think we're in very good shape, and we've been a leader in this process throughout.","The Fed's real-time payment system, FedNow, is set to launch in July, and ACI is in the final testing stages, anticipating new opportunities post-launch.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then following the rate hike. Yesterday, how's ACI kind of thinking about the macro environment through the rest of the year? And is there any, like, trends or shifts in consumer behavior that we should be thinking about?","Yeah, but generally, you know, if you look at – we have to remember in our products that are generally non-discretionary across all three segments. You know, the only place that we really see kind of consumer behavior impacts directly would probably be in the biller and merchant segments. But again, the biller, even our biller verticals are non-discretionary payment types. And I would say at this point, we're not seeing any change. And on the merchant side, we're very heavily e-commerce driven. And so just the secular growth is stronger in e-commerce versus in-store. So we're not seeing any trends now. As a matter of fact, if you look at our Q1 recurring revenue growth, which is a lot closer tied to in-quarter transactions. That was up 9% year over year. That's actually a little bit stronger than we were expecting at this point. So overall, we're not seeing anything, and the recurring revenue growth year over year is a bit stronger than where we thought we'd be at this point in the year.","ACI is not observing significant changes in consumer behavior following the recent rate hike, as their products are mostly non-discretionary.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Can you talk about sort of conversations you're having with bank customers in the U.S. about FedNow and real-time payments, like how quickly are banks expecting to connect, given you've overseen a lot of these go-lives across the world? What are your expectations for when adoption hits a critical mass in the U.S.? ? And can you talk about the competitive landscape in the U.S. and what sort of gives you the right to win?","Sure. So on the FedNow point, we expect adoption to begin immediately. I think the big question is how quickly will consumers really ramp up their use of it. I think it'll take some time. We've seen this in other parts of the world. Largely, those will... start to cannibalize cash transactions. Obviously, I don't know exactly how quickly, but it's a high value add transaction type for certain consumers, and I think we will see that adoption ramp up. I don't know exactly how fast, but we're ready for it, and our customers will be ready for it in terms of connecting that's sort of built into the implementation process. They'll have the ability to use it as soon as it's available.   And then you were talking about, I think your other question was, what gives us the right to win in our current environment? I think the products we have are rock solid, proven. We continually invest in our products and we really understand. We are very focused, obviously, on payments, and that is becoming a more and more important part of our customer's business. And I probably talked about this last time, I don't remember specifically, but one of the things I talk about a lot is that payments historically tended to be a cost center. So people thought about the costs of facilitating the movement of money. Well, now it's quite different. And now consumers and commercial customers see the ability to facilitate payments the way they want it to be an absolute must-have. So they want flexibility, they want choice, they want reliability and speed, and ACI is perfectly positioned for that. So when we go, when I go and talk to customers and potential customers, there's never a question about whether ACI is a good choice for them. Whether ACI can do it, there's no doubt about that. We are the usual suspect, so to speak. And what we do is we sit and talk to the customers about what we can do to expand their business, what we can do to help them meet their strategic objectives, which those are some great conversations. I think I mentioned a few minutes ago that I sat down with a central bank, and even a central bank, is looking for ways to increase the value that they add to the consumers in their country, in their economy. And that type of conversation is fantastic. And as I said, there was no discussion about whether we would be a good partner. It was how can we help them. And we're very good at helping customers and prospective customers understand how we can add value.","The speaker expects immediate adoption of FedNow and real-time payments in the U.S., though consumer usage may take time to ramp up.

"ACI Worldwide, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then can you talk about sort of real-time payments and how that can impact the biller business? So as I understand it, bill pay is one of the first use cases. But does your experience in real-time connectivity and sort of managing the infrastructure translate into any advantage on the bill pay side? Like, could you gain some sort of competitive advantage because of real-time payment adoption in bill pay?","I think so, yes. It is clearly a That is clearly a good use case for real-time payments. I mean, think about someone who's, you know, for whatever reason, needs to make an immediate payment to keep their electricity on or restore their gas or whatever it might be. Today, that can be a little bit cumbersome, and it can be quite expensive. Real-time payments makes that easier, quicker, less expensive. So definitely a good use case. Because we have the ability and we build it in to our products to be able to connect to all types of payment rails, I think it does give us an advantage, and we do talk about that with our customers. Now, it's not just us, of course. We have to help our customers be ready to... to facilitate those kind of payments as well, which we are doing. We're working with them.

Like I get the one-time recurring conversion, but the recurring segment was down as well. So just any detail there would be helpful.","Yeah, no, I think you hit it there. A lot of it is the decline is coming from the license fee. In that segment, the customer segment of ours, a lot of that business has shifted towards more of a SAS or recurring type payment So most of that year-over-year decline is coming from that shift from license to recurring. But you should see that year starting in Q2 flip positive and then further positive in the second half of the year.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe the first question, I want to get a sense of your assessment, slightly better second half for the year. I heard you are guiding, I mean, roughly speaking, slattish into Q2, but what are some of the factors that you're seeing that could get your second half slightly higher than the first half?","Hi, Charles. It's Russell. Thank you for your question. So, you know, I think, you know, why do we believe the second half is going to be stronger than the first half? So this view is based on our backlog, our conversations with customers, and our own internal work. So, you know, obviously we're continuing to monitor bookings for the course of the year. They seem to have actually stabilized, and I'd say at this stage of the quarter, we're actually ahead of bookings compared to, say, Q4. So that's giving us some encouragement there. Each and every one of the tools in the forecast now actually belongs to a customer project. With the turn of the year, customers have put their budgets in place. They begin to formalize and stabilize their plans for the year, and that's allowing us to work with the customers to make sure we understand their shipping plan. I would say that we have fairly good confidence that the second half is going to be better than the first half.   Yeah, and just to add into that, you know, although we're not giving specific revenue figures for 2025, Charles, and, you know, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect a slight uptick in the second half of 25. But, you know, again, all the factors Russell just mentioned, our backlog, the customer conversations, it doesn't take a whole lot of incremental systems for us to sort of be in and around that $800 million number for the full year period. And Charles, as you know, the secular drivers are still very much intact. This is a cycle. We've been through many, many cycles. So, you know, we do expect the cycle to disappear, start to see growth again. And, you know, we'd like to think that 2026 will be a growth year for us as well. So we'd like to see the second half of 25 be better than the first half. And we'd like to see some of that strength continue into 2026.","The speaker believes the second half of the year will be stronger than the first due to a stable backlog, positive customer interactions, and improved bookings.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe another question. Maybe this is not a big part of the business. I do want to ask about memory. It sounds like you guys still think the vast majority of the memory revenue in 2025 is going to come from DRAM. But over the course of the last couple of weeks, we did hear a little bit more positive Commentary from some of your peers on NAND side of the spending, but sounds like you're not expecting a pickup in NAND. Wonder if this is still a difference between Greenfield versus Note Upgrade, or maybe there's some hope that maybe at some point you're going to see some upside in NAND. I just want to get your thoughts on that.","Right, so we do believe that NAND is still going to be very muted in 2025. So yes, you're correct. What we're seeing in 2025, which we are seeing an improved memory situation in 25 relative to 24, albeit 24 is a low base. Thinking specifically about NAND, we only sell more implanters to memory in general, both DRAM and NAND, when they expand the number of wafers out. So if they change the technology node, and in terms of NAND, they put more and more layers on, that might be great for depth and edge. It's not really helping the number of wafers out. So right now, I'd say that, you know, Customers in the quiet times, they use that time to do node changes, and those node changes may drive some revenue to our peers. But until we start to see more capacity, and bear in mind, a lot of these customers do have actually capacity planned, but until they start filling those new factories, we won't start to see the benefits of that.","The respondent believes that NAND memory revenue will remain subdued in 2025, with improvements expected primarily in DRAM.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe a last question about export control. I recognize some of the expected China weakness probably has very little to do with export control, but you are actually seeing potentially the impact that could be at low end of your previously guided range. Wonder what's the reason for that, and what do you see, why you feel like you are able to actually shift some of the I don't know if it's a product or service, but that you are able to sell a little bit more than you thought.","Yeah, no, Charles, thanks for the question on that. In the 8K that we prepared, you know, we ultimately, you know, that was a preliminary estimate based on our, you know, review of the rules. And out of an abundance of caution, we included some system shipments in that number to build us up to the high end. So you may recall the low-end represented 8K. sort of the CS&I impact and the high end included some incremental systems that could be at risk based on the interpretation of the rules. Since then, we've received some incremental information and data that provides confidence in our ability to be able to deliver on those system shipments, which is why we're now predicting the impact to be closer to the low end of that range, and that low end of the range has already been baked into our guidance for the full year.","The question inquires about the impact of export control on expected weakness in China and the ability to sell more products or services than initially thought.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to start just focused on some of the near-term dynamics. So what are the things that you're seeing in the business that might indicate that the first quarter would be a bottom for the digestion that's occurring, and alternatively, what might be indicating that that may play out more in the second quarter. And related to digestion, since power in general, mature digestion is mostly in China, Does that mean there are some more positive things going on in other GOs or just an easier base coming off of the second half of last year?","Hey, Craig. Thanks for the question. So I think we've said that we believe the first half will be, you know, will be lower than the second half. We haven't kind of broken it down into quarters at this point. we do think that um you know obviously there's a lot of digestion in in mature technologies in china that digestion isn't necessarily just over supply in some cases it's getting to grips with the technology ramping and making sure the yield holds together so as you know china certainly has ambitions to be very self-sufficient they're not close to that at this stage so i think right now really it's all about kind of getting the technology under control before ramping Outside of China, I'd say that, you know, we have, it's been resilient, let's say. I'd say that we do see a business outside of China still actually holding together for 2025. And obviously, you've heard about automotive. And, you know, in general, IGBTs have been very soft. But I'd say, in general, we're actually seeing, you know, positive spots from the U.S., from Europe, from Korea, and other locations.   Yeah, just to add to that, right, I guess each of the, based on our customer conversations and what we're hearing, right, each of them are at a different point in their investment cycle, you know, Craig, and so, you know, get some who are continuing to push ahead, you know, and we think about this in the vein of silicon carbide, right, that we still have customers outside of China who are pushing ahead with their investments and building out capacity. We have others who are being a little bit more cautious in the spend of those CapEx dollars in 2025. But that mix, as you noted, relative to where we were in 24, you know, 2025 outside of China is still going to be relatively resilient, as Russell noted. You know, we are seeing a bit of weakness in that silicon IGBT market, you know, and so I think that the level of digestion there is a little bit greater in the silicon IGBT space. smaller portion of the business for us coming into 2025 relative to where we had been historically.

Yeah, and just kind of going to build on that. So we mentioned IGBT power is down. So when we look at our power business, In 2024, we were up in silicon carbide relative to 2023.

So if I look at wide band gap semiconductors, obviously that's kind of like the two exciting areas are silicon carbide and GAN. They have very different spaces. GAN is typically higher frequency, lower power than, say, silicon carbide. um so you know we're expecting both to have their their applications gallium nitride is significantly smaller right now as an opportunity compared to silicon carbide um one thing i would say is with silicon carbide it's really intense on our implantation steps and doping while we do dope gallium nitride devices it's not nearly the same intensity so uh for us you know um Silicon carbide and silicon IGPTs are very interesting because they drive a lot of implant steps. Gallium nitride, it does drive implant steps. It is currently what I would consider a niche application.

I'm curious, what is the opportunity for you for a FAB that's transitioning versus a new Greenfield FAB?","Hey, Tom. Thanks for the question. So it's actually interesting. 150 to 200 transitions seems to actually be picking up speed. We're working with many, many customers on 200, and a lot of them have actually taken delivery of 200 millimeter capabilities. So, you know, The thesis we have, and this is kind of what we're seeing, is that most people are going to bring up their 150, optimize their processes, optimize their yields, and then as the availability of 200 millimeter wafers becomes available and the quality continues to improve and the price continues to drop, they will bring up their 200 millimeter capacity on brand new machines. They're not going to transfer straight away. So they have the 150 millimeter running, and then they bring up the 200. Once the 200 is up and stable and more cost effective, I think you would expect to see the 150 potentially get retrofit, assuming the rest of the equipment in the fab is able to be retrofit. Because remember, a lot of these fabs that people started with were old fabs that they're reutilizing. So there will be some fabs that will upgrade and some that will not be able to.","The transition from 150mm to 200mm silicon carbide fabs is gaining momentum, with many customers optimizing their existing 150mm processes before introducing new 200mm capabilities.

You know, we've had no memory activity here in the second quarter, although we do expect some initial spending for DRAM as we exit the year.

And the timing and magnitude of those recoveries is hard to predict, especially given the uncertain macro environment. Naturally, as we get closer, we'll have a better sense and we'll be able to provide some kind of color on 2025 as part of our Q4 call as we enter into that annual profit planning process. But, you know, we really do feel good about the long-term opportunities that we outlined in that investor event. Power is going to continue to be a key driver for the business, particularly silicon carbide. We expect memory to eventually recover from the current levels. And as we noted, it's basically zero, you know, here in the second quarter. General mature can recover back to those prior levels as the macro environment improves. And ultimately, we're focused on executing on those market share opportunities we talked about in advanced logic in Japan. And so, you know, Long and short, we're really focused on everything that we can control.

So, we are expecting a stronger second half with continued improvement in the end markets that we serve.   Yeah, and when we think about the linearity of the second half recovery, it is going to be a little bit weighted towards the fourth quarter, Craig, but that is supported by strong order bookings that we already have in the ledger today, our expectations for CS&I revenue load, and we are seeing some positive indicators in the underlying markets, as Russell noted. The pace of customer requests for shipment changes has shifted from pushout to more a little bit pull-in, and we know that's sort of overly anecdotal, but those are the types of indicators that we are looking at, along with the quoting activity that provides us that confidence in the uptick we are seeing in the second half.","The company is currently experiencing a $1 billion run rate in the first half and anticipates a stronger second half, supported by improved order activity and a $1.1 billion backlog.

Can you just talk about the magnitude and the income statement, impact timing of those items that investors should look for?","Yeah, so the early retirement incentive, or retirement incentive, I guess I should call it, that we've offered to folks here is going to be a second quarter event for us. Current estimates, it's not overly significant in terms of cost, approximately a million and a half or so is where we're triangulating that as we speak right now. The benefit of that will accrue to us over the back half of 2024, and then ultimately right now that's been primarily focused in our operations team, so we would expect some benefits to accrue.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Russell, I was wondering, you made a comment that the DRAM recovery was a little bit slower or projected to be a little bit delayed from what you thought previously, and I'm wondering if you're surprised by that because we're seeing a lot of silicon being used up with high bandwidth memory now, and I thought that that was going to help accelerate the need for more just general capacity.","Yes, there's certainly a lot of news about the demand for high bandwidth memory. Regarding that, for us as an implant company, we really don't see a change necessarily in the number of steps to process that memory. So it's very much about the number of wafers processed in that case. We will see an improvement in the utilization of memory fabs, and then obviously we'll see an uptick in demand, but like I say, we're not a DEP or an X person getting significant new steps with that particular architectural device.   Tom, just to add to that, in the press there's been quite a bit of news from several of the memory companies in terms of the beginning plans for CAPEX for new expansions and new fabs. We're starting to see that kind of activity and that kind of interest in terms of the customers and the sales discussions. Yes, we're certainly going to stay very close to our customers, and we know from history that this particular market turns on a dime. So we are ready, should that occur, and we've been keeping very close to our customers.   Yes, just to echo some of those sentiments on the preparedness of the organization, we are making some incremental investments and inventory in those higher turning drives. And we're also working to find the right time to do the top-end orders that would come through from our memory customers in maintaining a sufficient level of capacity, not only to meet the expected recovery or potential recovery in the second half of the year here, but also for the growth that we see in 2025.","Russell discussed the slower-than-expected recovery in DRAM demand, noting that while there is increased interest in high bandwidth memory, it hasn't significantly changed processing steps for their company.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"When you look at the non-power part of the ion implant business, we spent so much time on silicon carbide and power, but in the other mature markets it's still a pretty significant level of revenue versus previous cycles. Curious, what are the biggest end market drivers of that part of the business? And when you talk about a second half recovery from a pretty good level today, what are the end markets that are driving that?","I think the long term cycle remains intact. We are in a data driven, connected world. So some of the items that are going to drive that general mature is the internet of things is going to drive mature foundry and obviously the logic market. Data storage in 3D is going to drive NAND. Data analytics, the AI is going to drive DRAM and advanced logic. So outside of the power world, which we've talked a lot about, basically the general mature is going to be driven very much by the secular trends we see in the connected world.   Yeah, and Tom, just adding to that, many of our customers in that particular market are foundry based. And so they shift around depending on what's active for their end market. So really looking to what they've been talking about publicly recently, it's been the beginning of some PC activity, the automotive kind of bouncing around on the bottom and industrials kind of hanging in there a little bit. The expectation is we really need the consumer stuff to kick back in to really drive that market quite a bit.","The non-power segment of the ion implant business is driven by trends in the internet of things, data storage, and AI, with key end markets including mature foundry, NAND, DRAM, and advanced logic. A recovery in the second half of the year is expected to hinge on consumer demand, alongside ongoing activity in PCs, automotive, and industrial sectors.",0,0,0,0,5,1,0.666666556,0.171428567,2,1,0.333333222,0.035294117,19,11,0.266666658,0.352941172,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"I want to ask a little bit more details by your various end markets, provided that your breakdown for the Q1 numbers, if I compare with the full year 2023 numbers, it looks to me that silicon carbide does continue to be strong. It's at a higher revenue run rate in Q1 compared with the full year 2023. Silicon powered devices are slightly lower in Q1, but mature foundry logic, which is not the power device, the mature general semis looks like it's tracking actually well above last year's level. So these are the three most important end markets for Xceles, I believe. Can you kind of walk us through what's the trend through the rest of the year for these three markets? I did hear you say silicon carbide will continue to be strong, but what about silicon powered devices? Are you expecting a recovery? And the current run rates of mature general semi, do you think it's sustainable through the rest of the year?","So, yeah, you're right. So if you looked at last year to this year, the power is about the same. But within the side of that, yes, you're right. Silicon carbide has gone up by the same amount that silicon power has gone down. The one thing that you notice is that last year we had a sizable amount of DRAM in our business. So this year, the reason why the global, sorry, the general mature has increased is because at the moment, our memory is quite low. Regarding regarding general mature, I think what is driving that? I think we certainly see strong silicon carbide power in China. We see that to continue. We have some visibility of that bookings. Regarding the general mature, I think Doug hit that one on the head. Basically, it's consumer spending. So when consumer spending picks back up and obviously we'd love memory to pick up as well, you'll start to see a rise up in our business, not unlike many others in our peer group. So really, we have a strong underlying business. We're kind of waiting for some of our markets to recover. And we do expect to see that happening in the second half, which is why we're forecasting the second half to be slightly ahead of the first half.   And Charles, just adding a little bit more relative to the power, one of the things we like to make sure everyone understands is the broad base of customers we have in the power, both in silicon carbide and in silicon. And so, you know, depending on what the car companies all decide relative to their EV, you know, plug-in hybrid strategy and so forth, we're well positioned across that that supply base. And that's geographical as well. So, you know, recently it's been stronger in China, you know, a year ago was stronger, you know, in Europe. So it will move around depending on the end customers for those products. And the last piece is, you know, it's not just automotive that's using a lot of power. As Russell said in his prepared remarks, there's a lot of activity, you know, for power devices in many other places, you know, data centers and so forth. Clean energy are just a couple of good examples.","The response confirms that while silicon carbide revenue is strong, silicon-powered devices have decreased, and the increase in mature foundry logic is linked to low memory levels. They anticipate a recovery in the second half of the year driven by consumer spending and a diverse customer base in power devices across various sectors.",0,1,-0.999999,0.013888889,17,4,0.61904759,0.291666663,5,1,0.666666556,0.040816326,36,7,0.674418589,0.292517005,1,0,0,2,0,2
"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Russell and Jamie, from your color, it sounds like as we look at the first quarter guidance and then the way calendar 24's linearity plays out with the inflection in the second half, that mix would be fairly even within systems across mature foundry and memory. Can you confirm that? And then on the latter part of that, what are the things that you see that give you conviction in the second half inflection as you look at your backlog and customer engagements, et cetera?","So, hey, Craig, this is Doug. I'll take the first half of that question. So, you know, mix-wise, power continues to be strong. We expect for the year power to continue to represent about 60% of our total revenue, and silicon carbide will be 50% of our total system's revenue. So we do expect that to continue to be strong. As we get into the second half, we expect the mature markets to recover, really tied to, you know, the economy more than anything as consumer, automotive, and industrial start to return. And then we expect DRAM to recover ahead of NAND, with NAND being more of a 2025 thing. So if you look at the updated presentation, We're expecting close to 90% of our business to come from the overall mature markets and about 25% of it from the general mature. And regarding kind of our conviction about the second half, uh, Craig, so yeah, we do have a strong backlog. We do have a solid business in, in, in power, especially in China. And, uh, in speaking with our customers, they're looking to, uh, to start ramping their businesses in the second half of the year.","Doug confirms that the revenue mix will remain strong, with power representing 60% and silicon carbide 50% of total systems revenue.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Jamie, it's real impressive to see how resilient first quarter gross margins are as volumes decline. And I'm hoping what you can do is provide some color on how mix and some of the other company-specific factors are playing out and And you indicated that calendar 24 gross margins could rise year on year. Can you give us any color on the magnitude of the increase that we might see?","Yeah, that's a great question, Craig, and thank you. The team has done a fantastic job of putting in place some initiatives here to, one, lower our cost of goods sold for the systems and try to drive some greater efficiency without necessarily having to raise prices for some of these products given the competitive environment. In addition to that, we have identified some service and upgrade opportunities which are providing incremental margin opportunities in our CS&I business. And given that we expect CS&I to continue to grow in light of the higher install base that we continue to build out there of the Perium product platform, that part of the mix is going to continue to contribute incremental margin opportunity over the course of the year. And then on top of that, it's also where the systems are coming from over the course of the year. And we are seeing some higher volume in 2024 of some of our higher margin products, you know, sort of shifting the mix a little bit towards that, you know, especially in light of lower memory volume year over year. As you guys know, memory market is a little bit more competitive there. Margins are not as strong on those products as they are in some of our other areas. And so with the lower memory volume, we're also seeing benefit from that.","Jamie highlighted that the company has implemented initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency, which, along with growth in their CS&I business and a shift towards higher-margin products, could lead to an increase in gross margins for calendar year 2024.

We're seeing early recovery in advanced logic, which, while less implant-intensive, Excellus has a much smaller position in. one that we expect to grow over the next years, but in 2024, it will continue to be smaller.

When I look at the margins, you know, going back to 22 to 23, you had really nice revenue growth, very de minimis margin expansion, and yet you're projecting pretty healthy margin expansion over the next year. Maybe just take us back to what stopped margins from expanding in 23 versus 22, and I guess why you're confident that it accelerates here going forward.","Yeah, that's a good question. A lot of that has to do with memory mix in the period and then the efforts that we are taking. So, you know, we say mix within the year relative to memory and then our CS&I business related to service upgrades and other opportunity sets that we see for 2024. But on top of that, a number of the initiatives we put in place to drive incremental opportunities on cost savings, specifically on the cost of sales line items, really are multi-year benefit providers to us. So these are things like the investments that we've made in the automated logistics center where we consolidated our footprint here in the Beverly area.

As we've kind of noted, there are some weaknesses in the business in and around memory and image sensors, and we've talked a little bit about softening of general mature.

So I think the mature foundry market, which as we all know, has never suffered a downturn because it didn't exist until a few years ago. So everyone's starting to try to figure out exactly how it cycles. And it appears probably tied very much to more economic factors and so forth. I think as we go into 2024, a lot is going to depend on what the economy is doing and so forth relative to that, which will drive consumer spending, drive the industrials back, and drive general automotive, not just the power piece.

It was a nice surprise in Q2, and part of it came from better costs as well as a little bit better mix and some of the deferrals. You know, I think on the last call we had talked about the second half becoming much stronger than the first half to get towards that full-year target of about 44%. And we're on that.

Yeah. Hey, Ethan. This is Doug. So you broke up a little bit, but I think you're asking about the high bandwidth memory. So for implant, the implant content is similar for any of the DRAM, whether it's HBM or other types. So what we see as far as sort of the goodness of the HBM ramp is it starts to utilize, bring up the capacity utilization of the memory fabs. You know, that's the first step in getting back to a good CapEx cycle. Then we see the PC refresh cycle kicking in, as we said, sometime next year.

Jed, this is Doug. So, you know, I think right now, you know, our guidance, our optimism in terms of raising the full year to 1.1 billion and pulling in the 1.3 model to one or two years from now. The strength is in the power market for us. That's where we're seeing the biggest drivers. We are beginning, as I was saying to Ethan on the last question, I think we're starting to see the memory guys start to increase their utilization as a result of some of the strength in the AI activity. The PC refresh cycle is going to be key there, so we're monitoring that. And then consumer electronics are probably the next big driver in terms of the mature markets as a whole for mature foundry logic type of products. And we're watching that and expect that to be a 24 type of event. So that's what gives us the confidence to pull that $1.3 billion model in. But this year...

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then just as a follow-up on silicon carbide specifically, major announcement by Infineon in terms of the $6 billion investment in Coulomb.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,And then a question for Kevin on the logistics center. Maybe just a little more color on the impact of both your capacity and potentially margins over time with a new center opening up.,"Yeah. Hi, Tom. Yeah, so the new center is going to handle all of our incoming material and hitting. Essentially, right now, we've got probably about 10 different locations we'll pull the material from. So that's going to improve overall efficiency. We're not going to have trucks running all over between the two cities surrounding us grabbing material. Also, if required, we could clear out additional space in that facility to put the manufacturing, but What's really happening at this point, as we remove some of the remaining stock room out of the Beverly headquarters, that frees up more manufacturing space in Beverly. So we've got, from an infrastructure point of view, from a bricks and mortar point of view, we're pretty much done now with what we need to do. We have a lot of additional capacity we can add on a second and third shift. Our manufacturing team, when I say done, our manufacturing team continues to use the Kaizen process to drive improvement. And there are a number of Kaizens, but again, in terms of more buildings between the CREA operation, the Beverly site, and this new logistics center, I'm very comfortable with our capacity to hit the 1.3 and potentially beyond that. And we've got very good supply chain partners too. worth case if we need to put some contract manufacturing capacity in place down the road, that's another option. So long and short of it, I feel very good about where we're at at this point.","Kevin discussed the new logistics center's positive impact on efficiency by consolidating material handling from multiple locations, which will free up manufacturing space and allow for increased capacity.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"It looks like book to bill was slightly below one, for the first time in a couple of quarters. Is this an anomaly or a function of the extended system backlog? And then also what are you seeing on the bookings front looking into the second half? How far out are bookings being placed?","Yeah. Hi Nicholas. This is Kevin. So, uh, let me answer that. Um, So I'll start off by saying, I mean, we're going to see book-to-bill fluctuate a little bit, I think, until there's really a much broader base industry recovery. And, you know, we wore down a little bit on booking this quarter at $193 million compared to last quarter, which was about $100 million higher. But if you go back to the prior quarter, it was down probably $100 million from the last quarter. So it's been kind of up and down. But I think the real key here is we have a very strong backlog still. 1.2 billion is a very large backlog for the company. And in terms of bookings and backlog, both, I mean, we're taking orders out into 2025 right now. It doesn't mean that all our capacity is necessarily sold in 24, but we're pretty full, but we're going out into 2025. So I don't, I'm not worried about this book to build because I think a couple of quarters ago we were, we were under one and then we popped back up and under one. And again, with such a strong backlog, you know, that system's backlog, if you consider we have a $250 million of CS and I business sitting on top of that. I mean, there's more enough revenue to get you quite a bit down the road without ever booking another tool. So, um, so again, I think, uh, we'll see it bounce around a little bit until there is this broader base industry recovery. Power segment is very strong still. I think we now believe that 60% of the year's bookings have come from power. I think on the last call we might have said it was 55%. So we're seeing an additional strength coming through power right now.","The book-to-bill ratio has dipped slightly below one due to fluctuations in bookings and an extended backlog, but the company maintains a strong backlog of $1.2 billion and is seeing orders extending into 2025.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Just on the gross margin front, when you're getting into new contracts and looking at the materials on a go-forward basis, are prices back to kind of pre-COVID or levels they were a couple years ago, or are we at a permanently higher level that's just a fact of business today?","So that's a good question. So they're certainly getting better. I think getting back to pre-pandemic levels is going to be difficult in some areas, but while there's others where we have more opportunity to change suppliers, for example, and some of the commodity level things, there's a little more opportunity to get the cost out. But we are, I guess the good news right now, Tom, is we are starting to see favorable costs coming in on material, which should start hitting us in the back end of the year in Q3, Q4, which is why we feel comfortable taking the margins back up on a full year basis to about 44%. You know, as you know, that suggests we've got to get 300 to 400 basis points better in margins in those last two quarters. And based on mix and based on what we're seeing with current supply chain costs and using up some of the high-cost inventory that we've had, which has been the other problem, you know, we feel comfortable with getting back, you know, and hitting our full year gross margin. So I guess, you know, a quick summary is some things are probably never going to go back to where they were. but there's opportunities through supply chain rationalization to get costs back down and maybe even better on some pieces of it.","The gross margins are improving, but returning to pre-COVID levels may be challenging in some areas.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"When you look at your logistics center that you're opening this summer, will there be a material impact on the model as far as increased cost structure goes before that? And ultimately, do you expect that to decrease the cost going forward or just it's more just to increase the efficiency of, you know, making sure things get where they go on time?","Yeah, so, I mean, we have the cost of that in the model. So, when we talk about the full-year gross margins and full-year operating expense, that's approximately 20.5% that's in there, Tom. But the reality of it is we have a lot of random buildings all over the place who are restoring material right now, which has a lease cost with it. So when we initially open, we're going to have some duplication, but over about a six-month period to maybe as far as nine months, these other locations, the leases run out. So the net impact of it is going to be favorable, both from an efficiency point of view and from the ability to have everything in one location.

So as I mentioned in the script, we're working very closely with our memory customers right now to qualify both new Purion tools and additional recipes. Obviously, things are slow right now, but as things do improve, we expect to be able to leverage the work that we're doing right now to actually increase our business at our existing customers and make some additional headway even with some customers where we haven't been particularly strong in the past. In terms of advanced logic, we've talked about this at length. We continue to work with all the major advanced logic customers to find opportunities, particularly where Purion is differentiated, where we can bring that differentiation to improve their cost of ownership and their device performance. That is ongoing, and we also have talked about how we have recently placed a Purion Dragon into an advanced logic customer. It's an evaluation system that is going extremely well. And we expect that to result in more business. And we've also recently closed on an evaluation for Purion H for advanced logic. And we expect that to grow into additional business in the future as well. So nothing really has changed, Tom, in terms of what we're focused on. We're focused on just meeting our customers' requirements, not only in terms of their install base, but also in terms of their emerging technology and manufacturing challenges. And, Tom, one other thing just to note is, so the things Mary's talking about are the things that will drive us to that $1.3 billion model. So as memory recovers, as we continue to make deeper penetrations into advanced logic, that combined with continued growth in mature markets and power are what drive us to the $1.3 billion model.","The company is actively collaborating with memory and advanced logic customers to qualify new tools and recipes, positioning itself to capitalize on industry recovery by enhancing existing relationships and gaining new customers.

It's been a pleasure working with you. We have not seen any significant changes at all, particularly in the mature process technology area related to power devices. I mean, there are always minor shifts here and there depending on FAB. readiness, but we haven't seen anything move out.

They're looking for additional capacity. There are all sorts of things going on with new fabs that are currently being announced and built. So we do not have any data points right now that indicate that there's an issue. And I know people in particular sometimes worry about China, but China is very strong right now, particularly in the power device area.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"The next question is really related to the new $1.03 billion plus view for calendar 23. So thanks for providing that update. The question is this. If I incorporate the first quarter result and 2Q's guide, it could imply flattish sequential trends in the back half. And that seems to fit with some of the larger companies that we've heard from this reporting season to date. I'm just wondering, without providing guidance, could you just provide some qualitative color on how you see the back half of the year?","Well, I'll take that, Craig. Thanks, Kevin. So I guess I'll start by saying we did say we expect to exceed 1.03. Right. Doesn't mean there couldn't be more there. But right now, that's a 12% year-over-year growth, as we said. Mary just talked about this continued strong demand. I'll also say our collective bill in the quarter came back up to 1.5, and I think last quarter it was 0.99, so it was one, roughly. So, you know, things are still on a positive side for us, correct? So, you know, it doesn't mean there can't be more there, but at this point, this is what we're comfortable with.

"Axcelis Technologies, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"I'll just finish up with a question that's related to that, Kevin, but it goes back to some of the prepared comments on gross margins. So acknowledging that the back half means a 300 to 400 basis point rise from here. But with some of the issues working out prior higher-cost inventory, it would seem to suggest that more of the step-up would be in the fourth quarter than the third, just given the underlying cost dynamics that are at play. Is that a reasonable way to look at things?","Yeah. Yeah. We're going to say incremental improvement. We obviously have to come up quite a bit in Q3, but it will be incremental improvement. as it comes through in the back half. And again, based on everything I see right now with the mix and the cost profiles we have, we should get very close to that 44%, but considering kind of the whole we dug ourselves starting out, you know, full year will be good.

You know, I always tell, and you know this as well, I always tell people, look at Excellus' gross margins on a full year basis because so much can move quarter to quarter, but I honestly look at always look at full year. And everything we do with programs to make things better, we're looking at a full year average. So, yeah, so I would, you know, you're going to have to step it up a little bit in Q3, though, to get there. But it will be incremental.

And we see that this, as I mentioned, is STM tool, which cover middle and low temperature by Tahoe and also single-waiper. And also we're making a breakthrough in a high-temperature STM tool. And that's also another driving factor. And plus also have our Bible Etcher and also continues our growing auto bench for number two, auto nodes. And then looking the real next year, when looking for probably our Supercritical CO2, we'll start contributing on our revenue too. So that's the one on the cleaning side. And then looking the ECEP, we'll continue to see that growth and both in the front end and also on the advanced packaging side. And we have a quite a good backlog in ECEP.

Hey, thanks, Quinn, on that. So... You know, for the quarter Q1, shipments were down, right? And there were a number of reasons for that that we talked about, right? The relaxation of the COVID restrictions, you know, where a lot of employees and our customers, you know, caught the illness in December and January. You had Chinese New Year, you know, the adjustments to the U.S. restrictions as well and some delays. So, you know, that led to a lower shipment number. And so our overall inventory uptick, as you know, it's raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventory. We expect our shipments to rebound pretty nicely in Q2 and beyond. So that's one driver for the inventory. And then I think you also know that the finished goods inventory Most of that includes the evaluation tools that are at our customers. So we had an increased quarter-on-quarter from that. We also did have an increased quarter-on-quarter of finished goods inventory that was not shipped to the customer for those reasons.

Is that a pace that can continue and where the gross margin implication is there?","Yeah, I think, Suzy, this is a gross margin. It really depends on product combination, right? It really depends on how much a portion of the high margin product versus no margin product. So I still think our margin still will be 40, 45%. And the reason for that is we're still driving our product. And for all other, like a cleaning staff, advance the single wafer versus also the other bench. And for the ECP, we have also front-end and back-end also too. So let's put it this way. I think we're still probably, we think our range is still 40, 45.

And, you know, so we see that as two major driving, 2008 and 45, and also, you know, power devices. But looking at the real tool, I should say, 28nano is 80% of the Canadian tool. But 45 above, and also including the power devices, probably 80% is the other bench. It's the reverse. And our product portfolio is both cover both applications. So I should say, obviously, I see a lot of demand for all the bench and the people moving 45 and also their power devices. analog devices.

It seems really important to us as we think about revenue and visibility. Duration looks like it's up, but you also have a lot of large deals converting as well. So, can you comment on that?","Hey, Chinjin. Good morning. It's Angie. So, let me cover guidance because maybe it will help to paint a picture of how we're thinking about the full fiscal year. I think it's really important. Let's start with how we ended Q4. If you think about the 5% growth that we posted in the fourth quarter, what we highlighted was that we did have slight growth in organic, which is important as we exit the year. And as you just talked about, over the last few quarters, we've really pivoted our business to what our clients are buying, which are the large transformation deals. And what that does is it positions us better compared to the same time last year on the revenue that we've already sold. From an inorganic contribution, I do want to highlight that the overall, we expect a bit over 3% for the year, which would imply, with our guidance of 3% to 6%, that on the bottom end of the range, organic is flat, and then at the top end of the range, we're growing 3% in organic growth.

Accenture PLC,Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to ask up front, just for Julie, maybe you mentioned stronger growth next year. Hoping you can just elaborate on that at a high level. I know there's a lot of moving pieces. On one hand, you have a big backlog, a lot of large deals. You have strong inorganic growth. But on the other hand, the sector is struggling with this weak discretionary spend, and there's uncertainty with global elections in the second half of the year. So I know you can't give formal guidance until next year. I know consensus is at, what, 6%. Can you just give us maybe just some high-level considerations that are worth underlining as we're recasting our outlook for next year? Thank you.","Sure. Thanks for the question, Tianjin. Let's just anchor on our strategy for growth and what you're seeing in three quarters into the year, because obviously expectations at the beginning of this year were different in terms of how things develop with spending. So what did we do? We leaned into what do clients need, and they need these reinventions. They need these big, large-scale transformations. And so what you've seen us to do is you've got to go with what the clients need, and that's what they're buying. And so we have accelerated our leaning into these large transformation deals, which is why you see that we have seven more than last year at this time of clients with bookings of over $100 million. Now, these convert to revenue more slowly, but as we're accelerating, you'll know that they ramp up and they will start to layer in And we are very uniquely positioned in this market to be able to do these large-scale transformations because they require the combination of services, everything from the ability to help them move faster through our managed services, our industry expertise. Everyone wants to do that with the eye towards Gen AI. So even though the transformations are often in preparation for Gen AI, they want to work with the partners who really understands gen ai and so how do we get there faster and so as you think about the reinvention strategy that's a strategy we've been executing for a couple of years and we uniquely can lean in and that you're seeing the results of that this quarter with the acceleration of um compared to last year of clients with that level of bookings and those of course then ramp next year the second is are leaning into where we are seeing growth in smaller deals because remember The discretionary spending is constrained, overall spending constrained, and particularly in smaller projects. But what did we do, right? We see Gen AI is the new growth. We have an incredible ability to pivot our people. You can see the specialists in data and AI growing. We started at 40,000. We're at 55,000 now against our goal of 80,000 by the end of 26. We're also training our people. You saw that big increase because we're preparing our people for You're now doing a transformation. It may not be Gen AI, but you have to understand Gen AI. And so we're uniquely able to train our people at scale to understand NAI. And how is that translating? We'll look at our bookings this quarter now getting to $2 billion three quarters into the year as compared to $300 million last year and $500 million in revenue. So starting to be meaningful, right? In terms of the numbers, we were at $100 million for all of last year. So we expect to continue to lean into GenAI. And what it's doing is very interesting from where we were, say, three quarters ago. It's acting as the catalyst to understand what you have to do. So I'll finish here, and then I'll just, of course, mention our ability to invest in inorganic. But right now, from a perspective of the pull-through, we're still reprioritizing. But Every other Gen AI project now is leading to some data project because people are understanding, hey, this is a great technology and I'm not ready. So we feel really good about being very well positioned as spending increases when it does increase because of what we're doing. And then finally, remember, we invest. in acquisitions to drive organic growth. Like that is, you know, so it's all about future growth. And I gave a lot in the script today to just help bring to life just how strategic our ability to invest is as we think about future growth. So not trying to, you know, comment at all on FY25, we'll call it like we see it, but we also want to be clear that our strategy is working and these deals will ramp up.  Yeah, and maybe I'll just add to how we feel just within this fiscal year. So we're very pleased with where we landed in Q3. When you looked at Q4, we do have, and you see that in our growth rate, a clear uptick in our growth rate for the fourth quarter. And I think importantly included in that is the expectation that our consulting type of work in Q4, Kenjin, will return to growth. And that we haven't had growth in consulting type of work since Q2 of last year.","The question inquires about anticipated growth for the next year, considering factors like a strong backlog and large deals against a backdrop of weak discretionary spending and global uncertainties.

Accenture PLC,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Julie, just a big picture, maybe too simple of a question, but just curious to get your thoughts on where we are in the cycle for IT services, Ben, because we've been seeing sector softness for quite some time now. Accenture has done well. You've had very large deal activity come through. You know, short-term cycle stuff is always a little pressured, as you said. Where are we in terms of seeing maybe things bottoming or short-cycle discretionary spend returning?","Yeah, I mean, Tianjin, I think, you know, it's hard to predict at this point, you know, anything other than what we see right now, right? So what's different than 90 days ago? Well, as we said, you know, in December, we really get visibility into our clients' budgets in January. We say that every year, right? And so as the calendar year, you know, we turned the page, what we saw was a further tightening, you know, of spending at our clients, particularly, and that affects our services and particularly on the smaller projects. So, you know, from a sort of trend perspective, right? 90 days ago, we didn't see the same level. Now you've kind of turned the dial a little bit more constraint. And that's where we see the budgets being set for calendar year 24, right? And as you said, though, you know, in this environment, we're taking market share and we're seeing building momentum on our strategy to be the reinvention partner with a record 39 clients with bookings over $100 million, right? So what does that tell you, right? So the clients understand the importance of the technology-led transformation, right? And the fundamentals remain the same, right? There's a lot more reinvention ahead. We're still, when you look at where is cloud, right, both migration and modernization, we say about 80% of the opportunity is ahead, right? Data and AI, about 90% of the opportunity is ahead. Re-platforming and cloud-based platforms, about 65% of that opportunity ahead based on who has actually adopted the more modern platforms. And security, well, I think security can be kind of forever ahead, but at least 65% ahead. And that's before you get to thinking about areas like digital manufacturing, engineering services, where that technology has only been coming online even in the last couple of years, sort of the modern technology, and, of course, customer, also extraordinarily early days. So, you know, where we really focus on is, you know, meeting clients where they are today, right? So that's prioritize the large transformational deals and then be positioned to capture the spending when it increases. And, you know, we see... the industry as being very strong because all clients have to get there. They need to get to the technology transformation. They need to get to reinvention. And that's why you're seeing, even as the constraints, you're seeing that early interest in Gen AI. I mean, a billion sales in the first six months of the year, that is the fastest we have ever built sales in an emerging technology. And what it tells you is that clients understand the importance of AI, that they're going to have to reinvent every part of the enterprise. And that's exactly where everything we've done for the last decades at Accenture, right? Being the company that can go from strategy to build to operations, deep in industry and functional expertise because of strategy and consulting all comes together for this moment to to be the partner for reinvention across the enterprise, not just to build the technology, but to use it to reinvent. And that's exactly what you see in these results, which is why I'm super confident about the industry in the future.","Julie inquired about the current state of the IT services cycle, noting ongoing sector softness and questioning when discretionary spending might rebound.

What you see in our resilience is that we are doing these know uh bookings over 100 million and that's what kind of layers that that just gives you that base right of resilience during this period as we said we've seen further constraint on the smaller projects so that's why you've got you know the updated guidance right but the base of these larger deals we feel really good about from a resilience perspective and then you know you know how this is right you you're at the client You're at the heart of their business.

Accenture PLC,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to start with a question on the revenue guidance for Q2. The midpoint there would suggest a point of deceleration, but we do have an easier comparison and there was a return to positive growth in consulting booking. So just hoping you can help us reconcile that and then maybe comment on the second half reacceleration that is continuing to be implied in the guide, maybe slightly steeper than previously thought. Thank you.","Yeah, great. Thanks. Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays to you too. So first, let me first start in terms of our guidance. I'll first start with Q1. And as you heard us say, we were really pleased with our Q1 performance. And as you stated, our Q2 guidance is the same as Q1. And maybe a couple things that I'll point out compared to what we thought 90 days ago. And as Julie mentioned, we do see some differences in EMEA, particularly in the UK, where we're focused on repositioning the business back to growth, and that's going to take some time. But Jason, what is the same is that we are still operating in an environment, which is the same that we described last quarter, where the discretionary spend and the decision-making is slow. And so right now, as you expect, and you know that we do this every year, we're talking to our clients right now about their 24 budgets. And so that's all, again, to be expected. When we look forward into H-2, To start with just what the math is, we continue to see higher growth in the back half of the year. That's going to start with higher growth in Q3. And our confidence in our H2 increased growth is really based on a few things. Again, reiterating what we talked about at the beginning of the year. First is our results in Q1. So we're confident, again, that we were able to deliver across the board as we expected in the first quarter. And also then, as Julie mentioned quite a bit, we made a lot of investments in our business in the quarter, and that's helping us pivot to higher growth areas. In addition to that, as we talked about last quarter, the same remains, we do have our revenue positioned in the back half of our year from these larger transformation deals. So that has not changed. We continue to see that. And then we just need to continue to layer in our new sales as we get closer to the back half of the year.

Is it isolated to just a few clients, or is it more broad-based, and what's the strategy here to turn demand around? Are you seeing any green shoots there?","Great. Thanks, Tianjin. So it is broad-based. I mean, we have, you know, we're seeing it broad-based across the globe and across clients, and we continue to see those challenges. So we do know that it's going to develop a little bit differently based on markets. You know, the challenges in the U.S. are more difficult. They're more focused on both technology and the technology companies and comms, whereas Europe, it's a little different, the complexion. And so over the course of the year, we expect that you know, the improvement will come at a little different pace depending, you know, on the market. And in terms of how we're addressing it, it's really twofold. So first of all, we're going to continue to pivot within that industry to areas like helping within the confines of how much they're spending, you know, trying to help them cut costs, working on things like customer service, Investing in more network capabilities. And what we're also doing is pivoting our business to the higher areas of growth. And, you know, you see that with acquisitions like we did Answer Technologies and Industry X in the U.S. We did Flutera in India and data and AI. And so we've got a lot of areas of growth.

Accenture PLC,Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Just my quick follow-up on GenII. I know the sales doubled there, and you went through a lot of good detail. I'm just curious, are the deal sizes getting larger? Is it pulling through more large projects from what you've seen recently? I'm just curious how that might evolve here as we get into the new fiscal year.","Sure. So at this point, and remember, when we give you Gen AI numbers, we're being very clear, it's pure Gen AI. So we're not like, you know, sort of talking about data and all of those things. So the Real Gen AI projects right now are still in that sort of million-dollar-ish on average, you know, range, and we expect that's going to continue for a while, right? That's what we're seeing because there's a lot of experimentation. Now, what it's doing, though, is leading clients to look harder at, well, where do I go faster, right, in terms of the digital core and So we started seeing a tick up, for example, in data migration. But it is still extremely early, but that's how we think it's going to play out over even the coming year as people get more excited about it and it also points out the challenges. But keep in mind that implementing Gen AI is not easy. Entire environments need to be set up. It's quite complex, actually.

Accenture PLC,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Let's dive in on the strategy and consulting. I know it was a high single-digit decline this quarter. Just looking back at your comments from last quarter, I think that came in a little bit softer than you expected, but then you also called out many new projects coming in related to Gen AI and other technologies. Can you just talk a little bit about what's changed, what that evolution looks like, and what's your confidence level in the time horizon that we'll see strategy and consulting improve over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.","Sure. Thanks, Lisa. So I'll first give some color on that. So the big difference in our expectations from last quarter and where we ended up really was all in the small deals. And we saw a further, you know, they came in lower than expected, and we saw that extend to Europe and the growth markets. Now, that was both in S&C and systems integration. But that's the big reason that, you know, we have a difference in sort of where we thought we would be this quarter. Now, you know, our job is to, you know, continue to pivot to higher, you know, where there is higher growth. And we're working on that in digital manufacturing, supply chain, data, and AI. But that will take a little time. And what we're seeing is that, you know, there's a lot of extensions going on in small deals, but it's the newer small projects. Well, at the same time, we continue to have very strong bookings and interest and huge opportunity in transformation. So I think our clients are kind of holding back on the small stuff and doing the bigger stuff, which obviously converts to revenue differently. But you see where strategy and consulting makes a big difference there, like in the DuPont example that I gave in the script where clients You have to have so much, you know, so much expertise in the industry as well as the functions as well as technology. What that means is that it is going to take a little while for the turnaround. And we're not going to go to next year because we really want to see how Q4 evolves. And Casey will give a little bit of color on how we are thinking about our Q4 development. And what I would also say is that things like Gen AI are a big opportunity, but it is early. So we did in the last four months 100 projects. That represents about 100 million in sales. That's kind of the average size of those projects where it is. And so we're going to continue to pivot there, but it just takes a little bit of time. So why don't I let Casey give you a little color on on how we're thinking about Q4.  Yeah, great. Thanks, Julie. Yeah, so let me just kind of maybe step back and look at Q4 and the overall guidance for the full year. So first, I did mention this, but I just want to just reiterate that we're on track for our business optimization action, so we're going to do about $800 million of cost for the full year of 23. Additional color is that for Q4, as we look at bookings, We think they'll be about the same as what we did in Q3 of this year and have about the same complexion. Julie talked a bit about small deals. What I will tell you in terms of our revenue guidance for Q4, which is 2% to 6%, at the top end of our revenue guidance, that reflects some improvement in small deal performance, while at the bottom end, it allows for some further deterioration. And we commented also in our scripts about CMT. And so within our overall range of 2% to 6%, we do allow for CMT to get a little bit worse. And then lastly, to bring it all home as it relates to North America, because these two factors do impact North America performance, in the context of our overall 2% to 6% range for the quarter, North America, which was 2% growth this quarter, it would likely be flat this around the midpoint of our guidance range, and reflect a slight decline at the bottom of our range. You know, and as Julie mentioned, obviously we will give you more color, as we always do, on next year when we get into September, and we'll see how Q4 plays out.","The question addresses a recent decline in strategy and consulting performance, asking for insights on changes and future expectations.

But can you give your view on how you see Gen AI impacting the IT services industry overall? Like a lot of people make an analogy to sort of the impact of offshoring on the industry and sort of other big sort of step function changes to the operations and the kind of composition and the way IT services is done. Can you kind of give your latest perspective on that, how you see it? affecting Accenture and your industry more broadly. Thank you.","Sure. Yeah, and I think another good analogy, actually, maybe even less so than the offshore, is more about SaaS, right?

Accenture PLC,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I have to ask, given the great bookings here today, your confidence in being able to replenish those bookings as we look to the third quarter and ahead. I'm sure a lot of people are thinking what's going on in the months of February and March as well. I know your guidance applies to reacceleration in the fourth quarter, but just curious about, you know, your ability to replenish on the booking side.","Yes, thanks, Kenjin. So we do feel good about our pipeline, even after our record bookings this quarter. And our sales outlook for the next quarter, Q3, is solid. We expect to have slightly lighter bookings than what we've had compared to the record quarter that we just had. And maybe just to add a little color, look, you know, as you can see in our bookings, there is just continued strong demand for the larger transformational deals, right? And... and the need to, in particular, build the digital core. And I'm personally working right now with clients across insurance, healthcare, consumer goods, banking, and telecom, all of whom are very focused on how do we upgrade or get rid of our technical debt? How do we build more resilience? They're trying to build digital products, but they've got really old systems. you know, we remain in the early innings of, you know, building the kind of digital core that's really need to transform every part of the enterprise. And so we continue to feel good, not just about our pipeline, but about the demand we're seeing, you know, really rooted in our view that all companies are going to have to do total enterprise reinvention across the enterprise, that it's really a continuous cycle of starting with a strong digital core.

Accenture PLC,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"So given that, given both your comments and the optimization, I'm just trying to think about is it more playing offense versus defense? I'm just trying to think about I know a lot of your clients are going through similar optimizations. efforts as well. How does this one fit, given that, and should we still think about this within the 10 to 30 basis points of typical margin expansion that we think about sort of philosophically, or could this be incremental?","Yeah, so just let me answer the last part first, is you should view this as creating the room in our P&L to ensure that we can continue to deliver on that enduring shareholder value model, including the 10 to 30 basis points, which, you know, for a short period of time will be on an adjusted basis. So, and if you think about it, it is, you know, I like that, is it offense or defense? It is offensive. I mean, if you look at where we are today, right, we've got record bookings, you know, a strong quarter of eight to, strong view of the year, eight to 10%, 91% chargeability. We're going after structural cost, right, to ensure that we're in a better position. You know, as you know, we've been dealing with the difficult challenges of compounding wage inflation. We've been doing that with pricing, but we've also been doing that with, you know, cost efficiencies and digitizing. And we have identified an opportunity to to go after more structural costs to kind of create that resilience in that room in the P&L as we look forward. So very much, in our view, getting ahead of and dealing with these structural issues that have been created over the last couple of years.","The question inquires about the strategic approach to optimization efforts and whether they align with typical margin expansion expectations. The answer emphasizes that the current strategy is offensive, focusing on creating room in the profit and loss statement to enhance shareholder value while addressing structural costs and challenges like wage inflation.",0,1,-0.999999,0.034482757,6,6,0,0.413793089,4,3,0.142857122,0.086419752,25,11,0.388888878,0.444444439,1,1,0,0,1,0
Accenture PLC,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"First, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing around the actual conversion and decision cycles? Obviously, the bookings themselves speak well to being able to do conversions, but are we seeing any changes in the sales cycle times or or the types of projects that customers may want to engage in?","Well, let me just start with the type of projects. I mean, what we've been seeing over the last several quarters is just a, you know, a laser focus on cost, right? So, you know, most, you know, most programs, you know, clients want to see a shorter return on investment, right, more focus on cost. They love cost and growth, but it has to be, you know, in most cases, a shorter return on the investment. At the same time, you know, it's important that not all industries are in the same place, right? So if you've got industries, like, say, in the high-tech area, in some spots on, you cost optimization is very dominant, right? You've got some of the other less effective industries, say insurance, energy. Everyone wants to be more resilient and lower cost, but they're really trying to deal with their technical debt. They're thinking about growth. You know, how do you reimagine the customer experience? And so I would say a common theme is that, you know, in this kind of an environment, everyone does want to be optimizing costs but where they're focusing is different by industry is what I would say first. And then to your first part of your question about are you seeing changes in decision-making, I'm going to let Casey talk to you about the yield in our pipeline because you also are, in general, seeing a trend toward these larger deals. So there is, and we talked about this in the last couple of quarters, we're seeing – you know, less of the smaller deals in S&C and to some extent SI, particularly in North America, where we're seeing more caution. North America had record sales this quarter, but in areas tending towards the bigger transformational deals, not the smaller S&C and to some extent SI deals. And those, that transformational pipeline is which is our strategy, right? Like if you think about it, what have we been trying to drive for the last few years? We want to be at the center of our clients' business. We want to be able to be relevant, really help them transform, and then be well-positioned to continue to be that partner. And I would just say Enel and MyScript is a great example of that. I mean, they're a hugely innovative utility. They were very early developers. We helped them get to the cloud, and now they're modernizing and once again being super innovative. That's exactly the way we want to work with our clients, be at their core and then be there for their next big transformation. Maybe, Casey, do you want to just comment on the yields real quick?  Answer: Yeah, sure. No problem. So let me focus really on consulting bookings because it's important to understand the impact of S&C and our consulting bookings and also how that relates to what we're doing in our larger transformation deals because they do convert to revenue at a slower pace. So as I mentioned in my script, I was very pleased with our S&C bookings and our overall consulting bookings, which were very close to the record that we had last year. And S&C participates and is a critical part of winning the larger deals, which we have 35 clients, over 100 million. And so what you'll see is in S&C, you may see a conversion that's a little bit slower than we typically have because we still do have some pressure in our smaller deals, particularly in North A","The discussion highlights a shift in customer project focus towards cost optimization and shorter return on investment, with varying priorities across industries.

Accenture PLC,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"The one area that was a little softer was the strategy and consulting area, and I think you guys called that out as expected. Just thinking about strategy and consulting, that you knew it was going to be a little bit softer, and it's becoming a little bit softer. Is that just more the move towards the cost agenda versus growth? And just thinking about what we can expect there going forward.","Hey, Brian, thanks for the question. As you mentioned, our strategy and consulting results for Q1, they did come in as expected. But let's talk a bit about what we're seeing go forward. And we do see a slight decline in strategy and consulting for Q2 before we're going to reconnect with growth in H2. And why is that for Q2? It's really a couple things. We do see that we are going to have some impact from less revenue from smaller deals that Julie will talk a little bit about here. And second, we do continue to see our S&C practitioners focus on high-impact transformational deals, and they're going to bleed into revenue a little bit later in the year. Those are really important to our clients, but the revenue conversion is at a slower pace.   Yeah, and Brian, maybe I want to maybe say to make sort of two points. So first of all, specifically on S&C, I think it's important to understand we really have a tale of two worlds. So our S&C work is growing high single digit to low double digit when it's tied to areas around cloud, enterprise, and industry platforms, talent, cost reduction, everything tied to building to the core. So underneath our results, that's growing great. The other world is S&C that's tied to things like ad spend, creative marketing strategy and campaigns and other sort of front office initiatives are contracting. And that's, of course, the strength of Accenture is that we've got a very broad range of services, even within strategy and consulting, as well as a broad range of industries that And so while at the top line you saw at 3% this quarter, there'll be a slight decline next quarter, underneath that you've got a lot of strength in everything that's really driving our results. And I think that's really important to just understand. But then I want to take a step back and just maybe comment on the demand environment. Casey just mentioned kind of the impact in S&C on smaller deals. First of all, we're obviously super pleased with Q1. Great growth, and we're really happy with how we're seeing the year start. Now, at the same time, what did we see over the last 90 days? Well, we saw what everybody saw, which was the macros continued to have uncertainty, and you've got GDP estimates declining over the past 90 days. On the one hand, our clients clearly are remaining ambitious. They're committed to reinventing their business. And you see that in the 24 clients with quarterly new bookings over $100 million, which is an increase over this time last year. At the same time, they're more and more focused on cost and resilience. And many are having to make pretty hard choices because the macro affects the industries differently. So you've got some industries, retail, consumer goods, that are much more challenged than, say, energy. But at the same time, and we talked about starting to see this last quarter, kind of regardless of industry, as the macro uncertainty is increased, they're being a little bit more cautious. So we're seeing some delays in decision making. We see changes in the pace of spending. And we're seeing some pausing of the smaller deals. And all of this impacts the smaller deals more than the bigger deals, because we're continuing to see that big transformation focus. So that impacts our revenue and profit build over the year, which is part of what we're seeing in S&C in the second quarter with the decline. I just want to remind everyone that this is exactly the environment that you see the strength of Accenture. It is because we are so broadly diverse. I mean, you saw it in the examples in my script, all around the world, all around industries. But who else could be in Asia doing border security, in the U.S. working with the state of Missouri on a talent and tech implementation, in Europe working with a European grocer doing IT modernization, cost reduction, and customer experience. Just moving around the world, you're back into Asia, working with a telecom operator, digitizing their platform, creating a new customer experience. And so you just continue to see that our strategy that we've had for decades to be across industries, a global footprint, and depth and breadth of services. I mean, managed services is on fire because we can digitize faster, get that compressed transformation, help them access the talent, and lower cost.","The strategy and consulting sector is experiencing a slight decline due to a focus on cost reduction over growth, with expectations for recovery in the second half of the year as high-impact transformational deals take longer to convert into revenue.

Just wanted to confirm that.","Yeah, sure. So I'll talk a little bit about on the attrition point, and then we can get into kind of what we're seeing overall in our cost and our visibility in that regard. So attrition was down to 13%, and I think all of you know, but there's a structural pattern in attrition that typically comes down from Q4 to Q1. This year it came down a tick more, and we're really pleased with that. And that means we have to hire fewer replacement people. It means less recruiting costs, and you saw that in our improvement in G&A this quarter. And it's less ramp time for new hires. And so, Tinjin, in terms of visibility of what we see, I mean, we expect to continue to hire for the specific skills that we need.

And the second question, we're, I'll start and Bill can lean in. You know, we're, we're obviously we continue to invest. We've, we've got an exciting lineup of product and technology. We're seeing a world where AI is changing everything quickly, very, very quickly. And we are investing as well. We believe we've got a unique advantage to continue to demonstrate very strong sort of overall health benefits. I believe our rich 130 plus percent year over year, right? When you look at our year over year, EBITDA improvements. It's actually 150%. Thank you. 150% year over year improvement. So while doing that, an incredible improvement overall, Eric, to your point, you'll see some of the things I highlighted today. We'll be showing quite a bit of this on analyst day as well. We've got a really incredible product roadmap. So we look at the strength in our current products, our product roadmap, show that we continue to improve our overall, you know, path of EBITDA expansion, but also invest in the core. Bill, if you want to add any more to that.  Yeah, I would say, Eric, I mean, it's always a question how you balance investment versus, you know, driving, you know, earnings growth. So when you take a step back, you know, we're driving 150% improvement and adjusted EBITDA on 22% revenue growth, right? And the past in terms of over performance, you know, we've, we've tended to, pass some portion of that through in terms of, you know, over performing, which is what happened last year. But we're always kind of thinking, you know, at the same time, how do we continue to drive future growth? So that's, that's always the balance. And those are the calls that we make so far. We've been able to overperform and still invest at a rate we think is important to drive future growth. So we feel pretty good about the balance, at least for the initial guidance for year.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to hit on flat market volumes. You know, there's articles out there from the National Auto, I'm going to get the acronym wrong, but the Auto Auction Association, showing low double digit growth in dealer volumes in January, and similar in commercials. So is it that you think maybe tax refund season was pulled forward? So I just want to get a sense of, you know, the market's been strong, but you guys are saying flat in 25. I just want to kind of understand where you're coming from.","Yeah, I think this is a great question. I think it's really why we also have a range. Let's start with, you know, I think the whole process here to have a range is to incorporate into that thought process, you know, what happens if it's flatish, like we're saying, what happens if it's a little bit better or a little bit worse, hence why we have a range. But if you look at the specifics, there's mixed data on what economists are saying is going to happen with retail this year. There's really a lot of mixed data out there, and obviously we don't want to be wrong. So to your point, January was very strong for ACV. We had a really strong month, and if the whole year ends up being like that, that would be fantastic, Chris, but we're not going to bank on that, okay? February, as you're probably also reading, it's not like anything changed at ACV, right? But February, I think we're going to see retail sales could end up being lower year over year. Now, whether or not retail sales end up being lower year over year, I'm not talking about wholesale yet, I've even looked at retail, it would mean that whether it was weather, whether it was interest rates, whether it was other concerns, we could see that February's challenges are either temporary or not. And so when you take all this in, there's a lot of crosswinds out there. There's the macro stuff, there's all this concern about tariffs and everything else. We think it's prudent for us to zoom right down the middle, zoom flattish. There's no reason for any of us to take all these different messages going on out there and predict it will be better. I don't think that's prudent for us and for our shareholders. But to your point, there could be a situation this year with the other wholesales up, and January showed us all. But keep in mind January wholesale was a result of December's activities. Wholesale is always a few weeks after retail. And so we'll see how much January retail was actually up or not year over year as the data starts to come out. And so let's start to follow that trend of how much really was January up, how much was February up or down. So I think we're doing the right thing for us and our shareholders.

So starting to have some of that land allow us to broaden our TAM we're really excited about. And so having the right locations is important.

The answer highlights that this growth was fueled by share gains, improved conversion rates, and strong performance in marketplace services, leading to the highest organic growth in years, with expectations of continued performance into Q4 while considering seasonal factors.",0,0,0,0,9,1,0.79999992,0.476190454,4,0,0.99999975,0.070175437,14,1,0.866666609,0.26315789,2,0,0,0,0,0
ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Obviously, we just talked about the accelerating organic, which is great, but you also have made these acquisitions to advance in commercial. What have you learned so far? I know you guys are kind of like, do, learn, observe, you know, tweak it and then move on. So what have you learned so far and how does it affect your future acquisitions into commercial or conditioning centers? How should we think about, you know, 2025 and beyond?","Yeah, thanks Bob. So we're so to your point first, we're learning a lot. We've got some great locations for our commercial consignors where it's really enabling us to both work with the consignors, learn the technology they'd like to see in place. You'll see us talk more about how we're going to implement our inspection technologies at these locations early next year. We're going to hear us talk about that more. You'll hear us talk about how we're combining our, some of our back end office systems and other capabilities. And so when you really think about the technology that we're building to help these commercial designers, it's going to help them make the right decisions. So when a car shows up, should they be reconditioning that vehicle or not? How much should they be spending on reconditioning? And I think we're really going to have some breakthroughs over the next year or two. Now, having said that, we're still early stages. A little over 5% of our current volume right now is commercial. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves just yet. Next year we'll still be investing in that product in technology required. But when I think about this in out years, commercial could become a very meaningful part of our overall volume.","The company is learning valuable insights from its commercial acquisitions, particularly regarding technology implementation and decision-making for vehicle reconditioning.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to ask around the framework around incremental margins. We know you're going through the commercial initiatives this year. You know, acquisitions are coming through. You have a lot of other product initiatives. How long would you expect to be in this kind of incremental range, 29, 30%? And once you're through with the integration phase, should we expect this to inflect next year? Are there more areas that are working on the pipeline that should depress that? I'm just curious if you could help us understand the near-term framework around that.","Yeah, here we go. It's Bill. Yeah, so what we've talked about in the past is kind of a normalized organic target in terms of increment till EBITDA of 40%. So our guidance this year applies approximately 30%, taking into account the investments that we're making as part of building out our platform to support commercial business. So right now the thinking in terms of next year is we'll continue to make progress in terms of improving that incremental EBITDA margin. But we'll continue our planned platform expansion to support the commercial rollout similar to what we've done this year while expanding our EBITDA margin. So we'll continue to move the ball forward, but we wouldn't expect that next year we would get to fully hit the 40% incremental EBITDA on marginal revenue growth. Yeah, and Roger, I'll add to that is","The question inquires about the expected duration of maintaining incremental margins around 29-30% amidst ongoing commercial initiatives and acquisitions. The answer indicates that while the company aims for a normalized target of 40% incremental EBITDA, it anticipates continued investment and gradual improvement in margins, without fully reaching the target next year.",1,1,0,0.055555554,8,2,0.59999994,0.27777777,2,0,0.9999995,0.02739726,16,4,0.59999997,0.273972599,1,0,0,1,0,0
ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"You talked about the market still being a little bit muted, but seeing some signs of progress as we point towards the second half. Could you just maybe elaborate on what those signs of progress are? And could you just remind us what the market looks like when you are able to say that it has recovered? Like, what are the kind of key metrics that you're focused on there?","Yeah, thanks, Michael. I appreciate it. This is George. When we look at the positive signals out there, new vehicle inventory is continuing to normalize. We mentioned in the first part of the quarter here, the first few months of the quarter prior to the CDK outage, we saw that really go in the right direction. We believe the only reason why new was flat was because of the CDK outage. So that was, you know, new going in the right direction, very positive. We're all seeing more and more incentives out there. We're seeing OEMs already, even with a high cost of capital, putting the incentives out there for new cars. That's fantastic. Back half of the year with lower interest rate, we may even see even more incentives going on when you think about what they could do with leases and other sort of products. So that's positive. One of the things we point to as far as trends that help us see the dealer wholesale market returning back to 2019 is the trade to wholesale mix. This is okay when a consumer comes in, trades in a vehicle, does the dealer keep it and retail it or wholesale it? And they've been keeping more vehicles from 2019 to now really just because there was a lack of inventory. And there was obviously first lack of new, then there was lack of use. And use is still 20% below the 2019 level. So we're working our way back towards normalcy here. But we did start to see a slight uptick in that sort of dealers willing to wholesale a vehicle versus retail, which says, okay, cars are starting to add up on their lots. Still not back to where it was, but they're starting to add up on their lots. As we start to see that, we will start to see dealers wholesale more vehicles. So, Michael, hopefully that's helpful.","The market shows signs of progress with normalizing new vehicle inventory and increasing incentives from OEMs, despite a recent CDK outage impacting new vehicle sales. Key metrics indicating recovery include the trade-to-wholesale mix, which suggests dealers are beginning to stock more vehicles, moving towards pre-2019 levels.",2,0,0.9999995,0.086956518,6,2,0.499999938,0.347826072,4,5,-0.111111099,0.08108108,21,8,0.448275847,0.261261259,3,0,0,3,0,0
ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Can you talk about the commercial opportunity ahead, and what is the landscape for acquisitions in the physical reconditioning auction space?","Yeah, thank you. We feel really good about where we're at with commercial. We've got really two parts of the strategy here. One is getting our product offerings back in support to be able to really support commercial through leveraging AutoIMS in the use cases where the commercial partners don't need reconditioning. And as I mentioned in the past, AutoIMS is the middle where commercial partners use. And now that we're included as a methodology for commercial consignors, we're doing well. We're progressing on that integration and looking to have that ready to go live before the end of the year. So very happy about the progress there on that integration. So that use case specifically would be a vehicle that doesn't need to get moved or doesn't need to be reconned, examples like that. And we need that integration in place to really support wherever the vehicle is. Then second market, which you mentioned, is a large part of the commercial category. Vehicles need minor recon. We say minor recon, a lot of times it's just they need it need to put on a tire or change, you know, it needs a key within the repo category. That's in a category where there's some reconditioning. You know, we now have 10 locations and we're very excited that we're on our way. You know, I think 25% of the way of what we said, at least 40 locations to get to over 80% of the population. So very happy with our progress on that journey of having locations across the country to help us go after the commercial space.","The speaker expresses optimism about the commercial opportunities in the physical reconditioning auction space, highlighting two key strategies: enhancing product offerings through AutoIMS for vehicles that don't require reconditioning and expanding their locations to support vehicles needing minor reconditioning.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"And as you mentioned across the country in terms of those locations, how do you look at the expansion? Is it prioritizing one area over the other or wherever the opportunity presents itself or kind of across there and then the timetable to get to that full footprint that you're looking for?","Yeah. And locations it's, uh, there's, there's really two parts of locations. One would be if we're going to go in via an acquisition, uh, which you've seen us thus far, the majority of these have been small acquisitions. Um, um, so really if it's an acquisition, there's an, uh, there's a viable, uh, business in that location we're going after. then the acquisition path would be a path we can go down. There are some markets in the country where there won't be a target for us to acquire. In those markets, we'll just rent some land, decide whether or not we're going to outsource the reconditioning and or do it in-house based on the market. In many of these markets, you could just outsource the reconditioning. And so either way, we're going to bring the offering really to all the markets we want across the country, whether or not there was a small acquisition or we go ahead and just rent the land we need to go to market.","The expansion strategy involves both acquisitions of viable businesses in targeted locations and renting land in markets without acquisition opportunities.

I'll start, then, and, Phil, if you want to chime in. So we didn't really – say, Rajat, what was the impact earlier in the call? All we did is mention that we did see, as you know, you covered the space pretty broadly, that new was going off at a really good start, and CDK really slowed down the new car sales and used car sales towards the end of the quarter. Our impact, it's really tough to put an exact number on it. It was definitely over $600,000 of EBITDA, and definitely over a million dollars of revenue. The exact number, we don't really know.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Given the experience a lot of the dealers went through with CDK, and we have heard from other dealers trying to explore redundancies and other options, you obviously are getting closer and closer to the dealer, getting more integrated with their systems, with ACV Max, and just all the other products. I'm curious, how do you see this event as an opportunity for ACV to maybe work more closely with the dealer? You know, I don't know, maybe at some stage, you know, get into the management system side of things. I was curious, like, you know, how you think about that opportunity?","Yeah. Um, I think it's a great question. I, I was on the phone with a top, a top let's call it top five or maybe top 10 dealer group. Um, a senior person recently on this topic. And it was fun because it was somebody that doesn't work with us a lot today. And it was really interesting listening to how he thought about the category and how he wanted to make sure he had more options. So I think you said it well. You kind of answered the question while you stated the question. It's a category where dealers are going to I'd be more careful about these all-in-one systems is what I'm hearing. There's a couple of different software vendors are trying to put everything into one stack. And I think they're going to be a little bit more careful about that. They're going to be, you know, I think they're going to be careful to make sure they got best of breed. So I think those signals could be good signals for us. I don't know if it'll change our trajectory for ACMX or any of these products like in the next quarter or two, like they took off, you know, I don't want to signal like, okay, it'll go down. we're going to start selling this so much faster than we are today, but to your point, it definitely can't hurt. It can only help the fact that we're here. We've got great products. We've got a real tech team.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Give us a little update on your, I'll call it kind of commercial land and reconditioning strategy, if you could.

You can now, you know, work with that. So maybe just give us a, you know, what have you learned so far in this emerging strategy for you? as it relates to land reconditioning in the commercial market itself? What are the pros and cons? And what are the kind of next steps over the next several, I don't know, quarters or years or whatever your time horizon is there?","Yeah, certainly, Bob. Thank you. So we're making really, really great progress. The initial locations we have are helping us build relationships with commercial consigners. Obviously, we're still in the early days here. but step one was for us to start to have, you know, a handful of locations around the country, start to get the technology in place, which we've got a phased approach here. The phased approach allows us to your point, get access to auto IMS also allows us to begin our journey of leveraging the ACV tools. So our first, phase throughout this year. We'll be starting to bring the ACV condition report and methodologies of leveraging our inspections at these auctions. So that'll be happening throughout the year. A broader integration, but this could take a long time to summarize, like a broader integration of activities is also going on as we speak. And we're also starting to get some early wins. For example, even since our last call to now, we've had both one rental car company and one bank where we get repos have given us several hundred units at a new location. And they were previously just working with us at one location. So this idea of build a relationship with a commercial consigner, show them it works, show them that we've got the right model for them. We had some early wins, albeit these were sold early. These were hundreds of cars a month, but even hundreds of vehicles a month starts to show the story, starts to prove that we're going to be a great marketplace.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Obviously, a very strong quarter. One of the things that stood out was the, I guess, operating leverage on your O&T or operations and technology line. Can you talk about the drivers there? Maybe the efficiency of your VCIs is, you know, how much more can you drive there? How do you feel about where the VCIs are currently? I know, like, Years ago, we talked about they were doing six a day. The best ones are doing 12 to 15 a day.

So, I would say we're making small incremental changes and enhancements to scheduling our inspectors and So, I would say small wins quarter over quarter. We're happy with some of those small wins, to your point. Those incremental changes will all add up. And as you know, in our more mature areas, we're already hitting our mid-term target. So, we're very pleased there. There are also, to your point, broader operating efficiencies from our operations team, bringing in automation and some of our back-end functions as well, beyond actual inspections. Look at those results. We're in one area, like inspections. It was actually a broad improvement. Bill, any more you want to share? Yeah. Hey, Bob. So I would just add a couple of points. So we've talked in the past about continuing to just optimize every aspect of our business. And we're continuing to do that every quarter. You know, interesting data for you. If we look at just the organic growth rate of our OpEx in the quarter with low single digits, you know, that cards out the M&A impact in terms of OpEx.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"The first is it looks like auction revenue per unit stepped up about 5% sequentially. even though GMV per unit came down a bit. So just wondering if you could comment on whether you're seeing lower incentives or what's going on there. And then just more broadly, you know, you mentioned that you're assuming for the year that the dealer wholesale market, you know, sees modest growth, which I think is consistent, but maybe you can just give us a little more depth on, you know, what you're seeing in the market and what you think the puts and takes are around like the market, you know, really opening up to its full potential.","Yeah. Yeah, I'll start and then you can share. Yeah, so our auction ARPU went up 20 bucks quarter on quarter. I believe that's the highest actually it's been since we've gone public. So, you know, you're just continuing to see the benefit of our previous price increases and other optimizations that we're doing in terms of managing our food. So, you know, we're pretty pleased with that result, especially in the context of GMB per unit going down 16 percent for year on year. So and that certainly drove the outperformance in our revenue margins for just our auction insurance revenues, which hit 73% for the quarter, which is also the highest system in the public. Yeah, what I'll add is we've been obviously pretty consistent that we felt comfortable with that midterm market sort of pricing our food targets that we've given our analysts and investors. And so we're on path to hitting that. And even though GMV has pressure, What we said to you all is even with the GMV pressure, meaning used car value is going down, we still feel good about our midterm target. So that should give investors confidence in our ARPU. We feel good about that. And then your other question was really, I would say, generally about the market. I would say Q1, a little more color would be January started out a little hotter than maybe March ended in. Just generally, you probably saw that with some of our competitors and others out there in the marketplace. The overall market in Q1, I would say, was okay. It wasn't like the market sort of like really, really came back just yet. Having said that, when you read all the TLEs, not just the volume, because dealer wholesale volume, I would say, across the industry was not stellar yet. But you are seeing overall, you saw one of our competitors even recently say used car values are starting to go down. You're starting to see, we look at all the signs of market health. We like where the industry's going. At the end of the day, used car values go down would mean that independent dealers will buy these cars more affordably. They can then retail it to their end consumers. So when we look at all the signs, even though some of them At the moment, from an investor perspective, you may look at GMB going down as a concern on ARPO. I wouldn't worry about that too much. We feel good about our ARPO. GMB going down will actually mean independent dealers can go buy these cars from trades and others. They can retail them to their end consumers.

So look at the two main reasons why being both customer wins customer wallet share, and also the fact that new car sales is starting to come back, and new car sales coming back is helping us have, you know, trades coming in to dealerships, which then creates the wholesale opportunity. Now, granted, we didn't see dealer wholesale grow year over year, but we are seeing the market at least incrementally get healthy especially compared to last quarter.","The question compares the unit growth of a company, which is up 13%, to the average decline of 5% in used units among publicly traded dealer groups.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then just talking about normal season with appreciation to year end, can you just speak to what gives you the confidence to say that given what we saw last year, where is it just the dealer inventories were bloated last year and they're tighter this year, or is there something else to it?","Yeah, Chris, the normalcy we were referring to on the call was both regarding thus far I would say listings and sell-through rate or conversion rate, I should say, where we're seeing a sense of normalcy as it relates to both. So, so far, we're feeling good. You know, we're both seeing the... And actually, last but not least, I think to your point, though, is the value of used cars. We do have in our plan used car values going down. So that is part of the plan. We do expect a moderation on GMV happening sort of month over month throughout the quarter. So when you look at all the trends, listings, conversion rate, and also our expectations on GMV going down, it gets us comfortable for the plan we've outlined.","The speaker expresses confidence in the market's normalcy based on improved listings and conversion rates, despite anticipating a decline in used car values and GMV.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"First, longer-term question about pricing. You know, when you think about your long-term plan, and where you are relative to competitors today, how should we be thinking as pricing as a lever to either gain more market share versus gather more unit economics and compound more revenue growth? So that would be number one, just a refresh on pricing versus competition.","Yeah, certainly, Eric. Thanks. This is George. I'll go first, and then we'll have Bill chime in on your second question. So on your first question, Our long-term targets, at least in 2026 model, is about $500 in combined buy-sell fees. We've been averaging around 450 this year. So when you look at the fact that we, that's only about $50 more. Now, assuming GMV does decline a bit from time to time, we feel very comfortable that we've got the room So instead of just giving you the gap, the gap's larger than that $50 between us and some of our competitors. I think the way to look at it, at least for now, is we feel very good about where we've gotten the model between now and 2026, knowing that the buy and sell fees at the majority of traditional auctions is pretty significantly higher than I think definitely well over $100 in room today, and that's not where the competitors may go in the future. So that goes to your first question.","The question addresses how pricing strategies can impact market share and revenue growth in relation to competitors.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then second, just in terms of the adjusted EBITDA guide for Q4, just want to make sure that is maybe year-end one-timer type technology investments as opposed to maybe a new run rate or thought we should be taking in on incremental margins going into next year? I know it's a little early to talk about 2024, but just want to understand the context around those investments that have some of the margin reversal in Q4.","Yeah. Hey, Eric. So in terms of your second question, the short answer is there's really no change in terms of our operating model going forward. But to give you a little bit of context, so even with the Q4 guidance, we're reducing our OPEX guidance for the year by about $2 million. So if anything, we're actually in a better position in terms of heading into next year to achieve even a break even, if not even a profitability in Q1. But there is an opportunity for us to make some targeted investments to drive growth next year. And we're taking an opportunity to bake that into our Q4 OPEX. So again, these are pretty targeted. We still have a lot of growth opportunities ahead of us, not just in dealer wholesale, but commercial peer-to-peer. And our focus is basically setting ourselves up as best we can for next year's targets, while still, again, lowering our total OPEX for the year by about $2 million. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context, but there certainly isn't anything beyond that or anything you should adjust your models to reflect.","The response clarifies that the adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q4 reflects targeted technology investments rather than a change in the operating model, with a reduction in OPEX by $2 million and a focus on growth opportunities for the next year.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"I guess just maybe back on the normalization or timeline of normalization, I think back in the annual state you said in 2025, give or take you expect kind of the industry to normalize. How are you guys monitoring what can kind of dislocate or change that timeline as we see various data points come out, whether it be industry specific or maybe more specifically kind of affordability or consumer challenges, maybe causing an overcorrection and supply starts to build as consumers struggle to afford auto. So any color on kind of any, I guess to boil it down, are there any changes in your timeline to normalization or from here, and then kind of the second question is, is how are you thinking about consumer challenges, you know, auto affordability playing into that?","Yeah, thanks, Nick. So a way to think about this is we have in our planning that the market returns by 2026, okay? And that's really how we've been thinking about it. And so we, yes, it's 23. late in the year here, but we do have some time, right, for us to kind of, for the world to keep evolving. You know, if you look at like dealer wholesale, you know, units, even over the last few years, just in 21 alone, it was over 10. 22 is likely over eight. This year, it might end up being under eight. So we've seen these changes. We're We're pretty comfortable in the fact that we will see improvements over the next couple of years. The rate of improvement we should all see. Let me walk you through why I feel good saying we should see improvements. So one is new car sales are getting incentives. And these new car sales incentives are important. They help drive affordability. We're starting to see incentives even for across almost all OEMs right now. That's a great thing for us. So we're starting to see interest rate incentives, lease incentives. So as you think about our primary source of supply today, being franchise dealers is where the primary source of supply comes from. As they drive more new sales, we get more trades. So that's one. Two, the other part of what you mentioned is dealers are going to want to be careful what's on their lot. And up until recently, you've heard us say dealer wholesale contracted for two reasons. Sales went down, new car sales went down, and also dealers kept a higher percentage of cars. You've heard us talk about that. I mentioned it earlier on the call. The later part of that becomes really important. As used car inventory start to add up, we believe dealers will start to wholesale a slightly higher percentage throughout the next few years and return back to normal levels. Dealers are still keeping an elevated number of these trades even today. So when you look at those two factors, we feel pretty good that over the next few years, we should see improvements. How much of an improvement? I've got till February to give you an opinion on next year at least. So I'll use those couple months to wait on our exact thoughts. But I'm feeling pretty good on some of the signs we're seeing. We even saw slight quarter of a quarter improvements in the market of dealer wholesale, although really, really small. Any type of improvement is a good thing. It feels like we're in that trough. And even if interest rates stay high in consumer affordability for used cars, a challenge for next year. I think new cars, we're going to see incentives coming out. OEMs are going to want to move that inventory. That's going to be more trade. And I think franchise dealers should be careful on the cars they keep. Long-winded answer. I thought it was an important question, so I leaned in a little bit more.","The respondent anticipates that the auto industry will normalize by 2026, monitoring factors like new car sales incentives and dealer inventory management that could affect this timeline.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to ask a macro question on the environment for dealer wholesale. You mentioned new car sales are sort of picking up, inventory levels are getting more healthy, which helps prime the pump for the used market, but also that we're still facing this period of high prices for used retail. I just want to kind of ask where you think we are on that curve of you know, marching towards normalcy in the used market? And how long do you think it takes to get there if the new vehicle market can, you know, continue its, you know, sort of positive trend?","Yeah. Hey, Michael. Again, thanks for the question. And, you know, we talked quite a bit about this on our investor and analyst day. And one of the, we talked about really the steps that all take place and sort of that return to normalcy. market conditions, one being new car production and new car sales starting to come back towards normal. We're seeing great progress there. So very, very excited to see that even with this sort of all the thoughts or the concerns around the economy, consumers are buying new cars. They're excited about these new cars. There's all these great products coming out. OEMs are starting to put incentives around these new cars. So step number one has been seeing new car production come back. And that is starting to happen. That's really an important part. We're also starting to see used car values start to come down. That's important because if you don't want to buy a new car, the used car has to be of lower value than that said new car. And with that also, it will help once interest rates also come down to those used cars. So think new car sales, right direction. We'd like to see used car volume and sales come back a little bit more significantly. And we'll also start to see used cars start to add up on dealers lots over the next couple, you know, when you think about net path of normalcy. So I really said the same thing I probably said on on on on. on the investor analyst day, but we are, these are all positive signs. We also said this year we thought would be the trough where, and that was all part of our forecasting for the year, part of our, you know, our expectations.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I guess one on some of your expectations around depreciation for the rest of the year. I guess what gives you confidence in kind of the trajectory of unit depreciation? And then I guess in a scenario where there's more volatility, you know, do you feel dealers are better prepared to bid on cars that are more volatile and maybe, you know, result in less arbitration if things do get more volatile?","Yeah, Nick, thanks for the question. Yeah, we do have as part of our planning for the year, we do have used car values going down, and we feel very comfortable. Bill can chime in some more if I don't answer completely, but we feel very good about how we've modeled used car values, you know, declining and what that means from average GMB. So, one, I would say we feel good about it, but then I think the flip side to your question, which I think is a great question, is what does this all mean for dealers? Because at the end of the day, They've got together a number on a trade and consumers walking in, they've got this trade of a vehicle, let's say it's got 80,000 miles or whatever, how many miles are on it. And they've got to put a new number on this. And that number will be going down throughout the year. We're helping by providing great data to the dealers, real-time data, not just the old way the books were done that were just based on averages over many months. This is really real-time data. We've got AI powering our data. And in helping those dealers with their pricing, more and more dealers out there are starting to use the ACV market report. We're starting to get our data into more places to help dealers and consumers understand the new value for that trade. And if they price it right, Nick, then they won't have a hard time selling it in the wholesale market. because they'll have priced it right to the consumer. So the combination of our real-time market data, how we then take the market data plus the condition assessment of that vehicle is a unique value that we think helps dealers in that declining market. As long as they price it right to the consumer, they'll be fine. And we're here to help them. I think, yeah, Nick, I'll just add a couple of points here. So our guidance assumes that Prices come down in double digits for the second half, so we've baked that into our assumptions. I would also add that you'll notice that we actually saw in our marketplace an increase in our GMV per unit in Q2 versus Q1, and that that was attributable to an improvement in mix on our marketplace.

We are assuming there is a steady decline in the second half.","The company anticipates a decline in used car values for the remainder of the year, supported by real-time data and AI to assist dealers in pricing vehicles correctly.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,Can you talk a little bit about conversion longer term? You've opened up sort of a gap vis-a-vis the industry and and want to understand what you see is key to either maintaining that gap or even widening as we've talked about over the medium to long term when you think about conversion and then also pricing you know you took price last year any updated thoughts on elasticity over the long term in terms of platform pricing and and maybe those two concepts are sort of broadly fed into each other but just wanted to get any updated longer term thoughts thanks,"Yeah, thanks, Eric. We spend a lot of our resources focused on conversion and focused on helping both sellers and buyers. And just to remind ourselves, it's both the benefit to the seller and the buyer to get conversion rates up. Sellers, because obviously they're selling more of their inventory quicker, faster. And buyers, because they're not wasting their time bidding on cars that don't have selling. So beyond the model itself, it's really important for the end customers. On the seller side, it's several things. So you've been hearing us talk about auction formats. You can hear us talking about these conceptually different lanes that where different vehicles are selling in different ways. We're investing quite a bit on this mantra of one size doesn't fit all and each vehicle should be sort of merchandised the right way. You'll hear us talk about that more and more. over the next sort of six to nine months. We've been putting a little out there at a time as we're building, but we've got a pretty significant effort on our merchandising strategy. And we hinted, and then I really talked about it more once it's all fully allowed. So more to come on merchandising, but that's one key thing. So I think merchandising is making sure buyers see the vehicle, right? And not that it just came up for 20 minutes, it wasn't seen, and we've got a pretty significant effort A lot on AI and matching this merchandising to the said buyer. So we've got all this rich data. We've got all these buyers signed up around the country and really matching sellers and buyers. So we've got a tremendous effort on matching. So some significant technology and other resources there that we're spending. And then broadly, when you think about taking the friction out, you want to make sure buyers are bidding on the right cars for them. So if it's a higher risk ASCA or a lower risk, meaning more issues or less issues on that given vehicle, the condition report and other data that you get from that vehicle helps you create that matching. So long-winded answer to quite a bit on us working on improving condition rates. This is never done. We can be on this call 10 years from now. We'll talk about how we're investing. on globally matching up sellers and buyers, right? Because you're really working on this connection of any given asset, making sure it's going from a seller to the right buyer. On price, and really, I don't think we could talk too much about that today, but I'll say that we've said that we've got more room. And a way to think about that room is how you straddle pricing with value. meaning in our base offering today, we give buyers quite a bit of assurance. So you can't compare it tit for tat to our competitors' pricing, meaning the buyers get a certain level of assurance. And then in addition, we'll start to offer some other buyer assurance initiatives. We have one product out there today. We'll be launching more. So you'll hear us talk probably more about that towards the end of the year. But for today, I'll say that we do have some more room Eric and probably more to come on that topic.","The speaker emphasizes the importance of improving conversion rates for both sellers and buyers through tailored merchandising strategies and advanced matching technologies.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"You know, up eight, market was down double digits. When we look at that outperformance, is that growth coming more from new dealerships added, or are you making progress on that vehicles per rooftop metric you've talked about? And then what are you learning about the cost of growth in terms of incremental investment needed relative to your expectations as you scale?","Yeah, it sounds good, Daniel. I'll answer the first two, and I'll kind of answer the third. When you look at our growth, obviously to the overall market that contracted once again, you know, the market contracted 11% in the wholesale side of things. We grew, you know, 8%. It was both a combination of new customer acquisition. So we saw new listers have another impressive quarter for us of new listers, but we're also doing a great job. within the wallet share itself, meaning more listings from existing dealers. So I would say, instead of thinking one or the other, it was really both. So we had great success in the quarter. And I think moving forward, you know, between now and 2026, I think it'll be that same drumbeat. It'll be just additional listers and additional wallet share. And obviously, between now and then, the market itself is starting to come back, meaning the size of the wholesale market. But I would say at a really high level, it was both customer acquisition and expanding wallet share. Bill, if you want to jump on the second part of the question. Hey, Daniel. So I would say the way to think about this is kind of there's two pieces on the go-to-market side. So in terms of our field sales organization, we're essentially fully staffed across the country. So we can continue to generate more volume there with the existing staff. Really, the only incremental cost is us adding inspectors as we continue to kind of add the number of listings on the marketplace. So that's the only variable cost. Otherwise, essentially, we're already kind of incurring the cost structure to support our future growth for the rest of the year.","The company's growth, despite a contracting market, is attributed to both new customer acquisition and increased listings from existing dealers.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,Can you maybe quantify where some of those efficiencies or cost savings have been so far and talk about maybe where the cost savings are relative to the 2026 timeline you guys laid out last year?,"I'll start building. You can go ahead and chime in. I just started to enumerate just the big ones. Our investment that in our transportation technology and platform, if we look at areas like pricing and intelligence, it allowed us to price our lanes more effectively. So instead of just having to take historical data for pricing, we now have more and more real-time intelligence. And that's really important because while a dealer is bidding, they want to know the cost of transportation while they're bidding. Two is scale as relates to transport as an example. As you have more scale, you're able to get better pricing from your carrier. So those two things are examples within the area of transport. When you look at areas like utilization of inspectors and our team becoming more efficient, investments in areas like auction format, getting a higher conversion rate, it allowed for us to have better utilization of our resources because, you know, increased conversion rate. And then I would also say generally one way to better have conversion is having better price guidance. So when you think about, for example, where technology helps you convert better is you're walking in and if a car, if you know the car's at its best day worth $20,000, And that's the best thing. The dealer is asking for $24,000. We know we're going to be wasting our time. So we now have a pricing engine that can help inform our dealers what these assets are worth. So there's many more. Those are like the ones on top of my tongue here that are areas where we're becoming more efficient. It's also in areas of better title management. We haven't had to really scale up in areas of titles and other parts of our org because that team has become much more efficient, having new tools. leveraging AI where we can now scan these titles, make a bunch of decisions just by scanning them. So it's many areas of business, Daniel, but those would be the ones sort of top of mind. Yeah, I would just add a couple of other points, Daniel. So first on transport, 80% of our dispatches this past quarter were automated. So no human intervention. That's just another example. We've talked about that in the past in terms of how we're using technology to basically become more efficient. The other big driver during the quarter actually were, um, we were much more effective during the quarter in terms of our arbitration costs. Um, the frequency, you know, was, was better managed by our team. Um, and it was material benefit to our overall margins for the quarter. So, um, as, as we talked about in the past, there was an ebb and flow to arbitration. But directionally, you know, we're going to be talking about this more on June 1st at our analyst day in terms of driving towards our target model. But directionally over time, we believe we'll be able to more effectively manage our costs, and that'll be agreed to tomorrow.","The discussion highlights various efficiencies and cost savings achieved through investments in technology, particularly in transportation pricing, automation, and resource utilization.

ACV Auctions Inc.,Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to start with conversion rate. You know, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your expectation is for conversion rate to moderate throughout the year as wholesale depreciation begins to moderate. But, you know, when I look at overall conversion rates, it looks like they were elevated in January and February and sort of trended back towards 2019 levels in March and April. And I'm curious, are you saying your expectation is for conversion rates to remain consistent with 2019 levels for the remainder of the year? Just some clarity on that. And then second question is, based on your revenue guidance, looks like growth is expected to moderate to low single digits in the second quarter before accelerating to around 10% in the second half. Can you give us – can you sort of help us with the growth cadence of prices and units in the auction segment, along with other revenue sources like capital and transportation? Thanks.","Yeah, certainly, John. I'll start, and Bill will go ahead and fill in. So we're – conversion rates were strong, and obviously there's also a seasonality part of the auction industry, meaning Q1 is typically your strongest quarter when you look at conversion rates. So when you think about our return to normalization over the next few years, at least from a forecasting perspective, we'd like to forecast that conversion rates start out higher in Q1 and moderate down. And then we'll see all these world events to see if that actually is true or not. But I think that's a prudent thing to assume as we start to return to normal. Obviously, there's a lot of factors. Whether or not we'll see it go all the way back down to a historical average or not, we shall see. But that's at least to be prudent what we're expecting. And that's at least what we would expect in the non-COVID years. The second question. was about Q2. You know, we're, the quarter, you know, it started off in a positive way. I really wouldn't read into this too much. Either way, it's more of, there's so many moving parts right now in the industry, right, across the, you know, volume, new car, new car volume being higher Used car volume, you know, looking at Q1, used car sales, retail sales were about 3% lower sort of year over year, obviously up quarter over quarter. You look at all the moving parts, we're just trying to be prudent, not knowing how all the moving parts are all going to come together. Yeah, I would just add to that, John, that, again, as George said, so Q1 is, you know, typically the strongest quarter of the year. You know, and Q2 is also a pretty strong quarter backdrop here, though, is that what we've talked about is we're assuming in the second half of the year, you know, supply continues to improve and our market and our TAM, you know, continues to recover. And that's kind of the backdrop for our guidance at this point, that we're, you know, basically assuming Q2 is a good quarter, but it's going to be subject to, you know, supply chain issues and how quickly those resolve over time, because that will affect the supply into the wholesale marketplace. So, you know, on balance for the year, you know, again, we're raising our overall guidance and growth targets. And at this point, we're still early, of course, in the year. So right now, that's kind of the way we think about it. And hopefully that helps you understand the backdrop that we're using in terms of our assumptions for growth.","The speaker expects conversion rates to start higher in Q1 and gradually moderate throughout the year, potentially aligning with 2019 levels, while acknowledging various industry factors that could influence this trend.

So, you know, our pipeline is incredibly strong. We made some really great momentum that you can see by the number of deals that we close at the end of the year. We see that momentum keeping up. One of the things about our business, it's really, really focused on discipline. And so with that being said, getting the proper economics is really what is most important to us. And with that being said, you could have some volatility in terms of the timing when deals get signed. The pipeline remains strong. You remain very confident in executing on that pipeline. So, when you take a look at the midpoint, that's kind of really what we shoot to. But we want to be a little bit realistic in terms of being patient and what you're seeing at the lower end is the possibility of taking a little bit longer and holding to our point and trying to get to the lower end of the guidance. Getting I'm starting getting the deal economics that we really desire. So, I end of the guidance is things executing at the velocity. What we kind of witnessed at the end of Q4 and maybe seen some further progress on that. So we're very excited.

Adeia Inc. ,Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,Could you just talk about the semiconductor transfer agreement because transfer usually doesn't mean any sort of a cash or licensing.,"Oh, hey, Hamid. This is Paul Davis. Yeah, absolutely. So this is a deal that as I noted on the call that we're really happy with that came together towards the end of the year. We were at a conference in the middle of the year and they approached us. It's a technology transfer agreement. And so that's part of our semiconductor business where we will not only provide a license to our patent portfolio, but also provide know-how and engineering hours for a customer to really get them up to speed. This particular customer is focused on really high performance imaging and detection systems. They have their own cutting edge silicon that they work on and so wanted to have hybrid bonding as part of their offerings. And so our engineering team being able to work with them is critical. So it's not a transfer in the sense of from a value standpoint. We certainly do get value and cash from the technology transfer part of our agreements, generally speaking, with those types of deals.","The semiconductor transfer agreement involves providing a customer with a license to a patent portfolio, along with engineering support and know-how, to enhance their high-performance imaging systems.

So I'm assuming the semiconductor deal is still very questionable.","Yeah, I mean, you know, like you know, and you've talked to us, you know, these deals are very large. They're complex. They take time getting them right. And sometimes we do have, you know, a push out in time to make sure we get the right economics. We're still very much engaged with this customer.

Are they, you know, IP portfolios that have been passed around and non-operating type companies? Can you talk about the origins of some of these and what you're seeing as far as opportunities?","Yeah, absolutely, Matt. You know, we actually did five patent portfolio acquisitions in 2024. And really with a focus again on OTT and broadband connectivity. You know, the sourcing of the deals have come from, you know, public companies, private companies that are smaller, might need funding. And that we have evaluated in terms of being very excited about the IP and being a fit within our existing R&D efforts. And so it's really a broad source of different ways that come to us. Our corporate development team does outreach and knows people in the industry and also sometimes brokers that come and approach us as well.

Can you draw like almost like a direct link to what you have in the pipeline to how that might accelerate opportunities in the pipeline? Or is that a little bit more morphed to send, you know, you see future opportunities to bring them into deals, but it's not something that you see happening in a six month period?","Yeah, that's a great question, Matt. You know, we start with making sure we have clear alignment between our business units and the corporate development team on the strategies that we are focused on. Our growth strategies remain the same, which is semiconductors, OTT, and the media adjacent markets. So we start with those categories of where we could add to the portfolios through acquisitions and really target specific areas then within that subcategories where we identify gaps in our existing portfolio that we might have, where we could really augment and accelerate those growth opportunities. And so, you know, OTT was a certain area as we really tried to focus on getting those deals done. Amazon is a great example of that. And then also the Disney litigation that we filed. Our proof points of our belief in both our organic and our inorganic patent portfolios that we have. You'll also note though that we, you know, we expanded into broadband connectivity and we acquired a portfolio related to that. And that might be an area we haven't really talked much about before. But if you think about our existing customers, especially around pay TV and their businesses and what they're focused on, that's a key area for them and a key revenue stream for them.

And, and it's, it's really exciting for us as, as that hybrid bonding adoption as I said in my prepared remarks are really seeing it across, you know, a number of industries, including Obviously, flash memory, where we're seeing increased adoption after our signing of our deals with with Kyokusha and Western Digital last year. And then also in logic, we continue to see more devices. And then finally, we're continuing to monitor and look at what what people are talking about and high bandwidth memory as well.

So I kind of start with, you know, the catalyst is kind of thinking about, even with the guidance that we've talked about, the overall stability in our business. So, you know, really with that, and we talk about capital allocation, one thing that we didn't mention in some of our prepared remarks is that that cash flow outlook that we've alluded to, noting that it was going to be, you know, slightly above what we had realized in 2023, is absolutely on point today. Our outlook is that we see the strength in the cashflow and that's a minimum expectation that we have for ourselves. So if you take that strength and outlook in our business, coupled with our backlog, coupled with the opportunities, and then the cherry on top, quite frankly, is the repricing that we have and the interest rates. We have a tremendous amount more flexibility. So in Q4, you're going to see a few things. You're going to see us paying down some of our debt, and you're going to see us starting... some of the share repurchase programs that we alluded to with the $200 million authorization that our board has allotted us.

So 85 plus percent of our portfolio is homegrown. It's from our inventors. And we see that really maintaining in that zip code. However, there are occasionally opportunities that come to us or that we source where we see an opportunity to really add to the portfolio that augments our internal efforts as well.

And so the exact timing of it can shift quarter to quarter, but given where the deals are that we have in our pipeline, we're still very confident that they'll close this year.

Adeia Inc. ,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,You're running at an average so far this year about 85 million per quarter. Is that a good baseline for the business or is it gonna be higher without the licensing deals happening?,"Hi, Ahmed, that's a great question. So I think that 85 is not necessarily a baseline. There's a number of renewals that we're working on. And then if you add in the subsequent license agreements that Paul's referring to that we talked about both for OT and semiconductor, you're gonna have a much higher baseline revenue level. So that is not what we see as an ongoing run rate. We see that run rate being much higher and that acts as a really good springboard as we move forward into 2025.","The current average of 85 million per quarter is not considered a baseline for the business, as upcoming renewals and new licensing agreements are expected to significantly increase revenue, leading to a higher run rate moving into 2025.",0,0,0,0,0,1,-0.999999,0.09999999,1,1,0,0.054054053,5,3,0.249999969,0.21621621,0,0,0,0,0,0
Adeia Inc. ,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"With respect to the larger deals that we're kind of looking for in the back half of 2024, how does the expectation for interest rate environment and kind of the macro backdrop influence the discussions around those licenses? Is there a risk that uncertainty in macro could prolong discussions or just help us understand some of the sensitivity there?","Yeah, Matt, I think we often get that question, especially in times of uncertainty and what we've experienced historically given the long-term nature of the deals that we do is that that usually has very little impact on the overall timing or economics that we're able to achieve. I think the customers that we are often talking to are very large, sophisticated companies. They understand that there's going to be various cycles that the industry goes through. Certainly on the semiconductor side of things, there are very well-known cycles where there are ups and downs and same with media, whether it be in advertising or otherwise, where you see cycles of really a boom and then a slowdown. For us though, we're usually able to navigate through that and get those deals done really at the same level of expectations we have. And so we don't anticipate really seeing any sort of challenges because of that environment.","The question addresses how the interest rate environment and macroeconomic uncertainty might affect discussions around large deals in late 2024.

Adeia Inc. ,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"On the question on the OpEx run rate, it sounds like you had a couple of moving pieces in the OpEx number this quarter, some in favor, and then maybe some increase in outside spending. So I guess, can you give us a bit of a sense of what we should be expecting as the baseline moving forward?","Yeah, Matt, great question. So if you take a look at our OpEx, we'll kind of look at a few items here. So our R&D has been on an upward tick and that's by design and plan. We continue to make a concert effort to invest and grow our patent portfolio. So we will continue to see that trajectory. And if you take a look at even the amount relative to our revenue as a percentage, it's gonna be in that mid teens throughout the remainder of the year. So that is the path that we had anticipated to continue to go through that. And also what you see from there is us making some of those investments outside from a third party perspective to help accelerate some of those efforts. On the SG&A side, we had a good guy, as I like to call it. We had the bad debt recovery, but if you kind of even that out and as well as some of the administrative costs, we would have a slight uptick quarter over quarter if you just kind of balance those two. Well, what we've seen, and quite frankly, this puts a smile on my face as being part of the management team, is we've actually done a tremendous job internally of developing out these new platforms. When I say these new platforms, it's the six new areas in our new media. And then also on semiconductor side, most notably as we talked about co-optionization. So what we really wanted to do was give ourselves a lot of expertise in wiggle room just to really kind of grow these platforms. And with that doing deep dives in terms of learning about the customers, doing product breakdowns and all those other good things. And what we found is that while we have a new team, we have a very talented team that gets up to speed extremely quickly. So we're making great progress with a less of a reliance on outside third parties. And that's what you see in terms of us bringing down our overall guidance, and in part with a little bit lower spin in the first half of the year on litigation. But you will see an uptick in Q3 and then a little bit more modestly in Q4. As you see, we reset the guidance to be about $5 million lower than we set out the beginning of the year.","The OpEx run rate is expected to remain in the mid-teens percentage of revenue, driven by increased R&D investments and some outside spending, while SG&A may see a slight uptick due to administrative costs.

So one of the things that we when we take a look at our expenses and that ramp from the back half of the year is quite frankly, it's a success story. So one of the things that we have talked about is building out our platforms, making those investments faster. which includes a bit of third-party spend to get subject matter expertise, domain expertise. And what we really found that was actually fantastic is that some of those projects that we had earmarked early on for the first half of the year, we were quite candidly able to reach those milestones and do with our own internal resources rather than using outside third parties, which is absolutely fantastic. and speaks well to our employees and what they're able to do with that being said, that creates an opportunity for us, not necessarily to save that money, but actually to invest it in other initiatives, which we have target for the second half of the year.

So certainly co-optimization is something that we are continuing to be very excited about. It's a longer term play for us. It's something that we kicked off, as you noted, in Q1.

So from where we had separation and what we saw as a plan to expand our business, you know, growing beyond our base with pay TV, we had very much started that journey of adding resources, adding subject matter expertise and making true investments from our R&D and more so from an SG&A perspective as well for those businesses. So if you take a look at our financials, you really start seeing that inflections in our financials really in Q3 of last year, where we've seen continuous kind of uptick and spend in those areas.

Can you just talk about where you were able to pull back within OpEx and so quickly?,"You know, great question. And to be very, very precise, it all has to do with our litigation expense primarily. That's the biggest driver. Nikki, if you recall, when we talked about our guidance in the beginning of the year, and even at the time of separation, we had said we had been running historically lower levels. Last year, we did about $10 million. And if you take a look at, we were at the nine months now, we're at the same spot where we were a year ago this time. And with that being said, it's just really a matter of timing. Both Paul and I would have anticipated a little bit higher spend. That's not indicative of anything. It's just really about timing. So that is the delta. But more precisely, what I'm really proud of is that if we take a look at the other line items being R&D and spends and SG&A, those are really spot on from what we had forecasted. So I take great pride that our variance from what we forecast as a company, it's, I'll just say, very low single digit delta from what we experienced.

The second one, semiconductors, which we think can be very significant within that time period. And then the last one is the new verticals. And on each of those fronts, we're seeing traction. So in OTT, obviously, we've signed two deals in the last two quarters, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're very excited about the progress that we're making there. in semiconductors, in addition to the large deals we signed with Kyokusha and WD, which will continue to add to that recurring revenue. We continue to have tremendous traction in the logic space and seeing what other companies are doing that.

Happy to expand on that. I'd really look at it both from the media and the semiconductor part of our business differently.

It's been part of our innovations that have actually helped drive current license agreements that we have. We're also, you know, today focused on AI technologies primarily around, you know, kind of VR, AR, mixed reality use cases as we see, you know, those developing in the marketplace. Going forward, though, what excites me in media is really the AI economy broadly as there's a proliferation of more content out there that's using AI and how we can capitalize on that development as well. So for us, this generative AI explosion is very exciting as we look forward in the media space and how much more is going to be out there in terms of our efforts and how our portfolio will continue to apply.

You know, on the semi side, it's really, you know, what has driven the ability, you know, AI has been around for a while. The current generative AI explosion that you're seeing today is because semiconductors now are able to process so much of this, right? And the next generation of semiconductor chips that are going to continue to be able to process more and more on the edge in particular is going to need advancements in semiconductor technologies.

Thanks, Hamid. Appreciate the question. So a couple ways I'd look at it. You know, if you look at over the last two quarters, you're right. It's about 18 deals. We're very pleased with that. It certainly can fluctuate quarter to quarter because it's just the timing of when deals come out. So not all quarters will start equally because you'll have a different number of deals that will come up that you're trying to get done.

So if we take a look at our business, we've had inflection points at different quarters and different periods in time. So Q3 to your point of 2022, we had a lower point. We had a bit of a dip. But if you also go back a little bit further, Q4 21 was that. And it just really has to do with the phenomenon of our business of really doing a relatively small number of large deals.

So in the beginning, the volumes will be modest. And with that, that is not at a level of being significant enough for us to change the baseline.

As for the other GOs, we saw broad weakness, but upside in the U.S., which returned to sequential growth, driven mainly by our BMS and wireless BMS portfolio. Secular demand for ADAS and next-gen infotainment continues to drive strength globally for our functionally safe power, audio, and video connectivity solutions. Content and share growth in these areas have helped offset broad inventory headwinds, resulting in a shallower correction in other end markets. I'd also note that while BMS is still facing inventory headwinds broadly, we saw a strong uptick in China reflecting the expanded share we talked about on our Q2 call compounded by volume growth in the region. BMS also improved in the U.S., including growth for our higher-content wireless solution, which is now 10% of total BMS.

So I was hoping you could kind of use that as a backdrop and then maybe layer in kind of your thoughts on how the cycle will kind of emerge from today's trough and you know, what your kind of thoughts are in terms of pushing, you know, business through 25 and 26.","Yeah, thanks, CJ. So, yeah, obviously we've already stated our first quarter will be down, so we expect to start getting back to a positive growth trajectory in the second quarter. I think during 25, if I were to kind of rank the market recoveries, I think it will be led by industrial. We have very healthy customer inventories. The channel is below seven weeks, and that's a big part of the supply chain into the industrial sector. You've coupled that with the green shoots that we've mentioned already in areas like AI tests and aerospace and defense, which I called out in the script. So I think the compare is easier overall. And as a result, I think industrial, given the signs we see, will recover briskly in 25. I think in consumer, we have a much more diversified business than we've ever had. We've got a better portfolio than we've ever had. Inventory is normalized. we're already seeing the benefits. We saw it in our four key results, three and four key results, the strength of our consumer business. I think next is the comms business. It declined by over 30% in 2024. And I think that was really an inventory digestion issue. So we feel at this point that we're through the worst of the supply normalization. And as we talked about in the scripts, we're beginning to see steady demand improvement, particularly in wireline, driven by the build out of these new externalized intelligence systems and the AI infrastructure. So we're not seeing much on the wireless side. I think at a low point in wireless, during 24, So I think it'll all depend on carrier CapEx investments in 5G moving ahead. Last but not least, the automotive sector. We expect to see continued momentum in areas of functionally safe power, the connectivity things that I spoke about, and essentially we expect globally to be driving share and penetration across all the different types of platforms. So, you know, we've had a tough year in 24 in BMS. Twenty-five, we expect to see that get back to a better shape, get back to a growth pattern. And, you know, given that all that was done, just 2% in 2024, it's a tough compare moving ahead. But overall, we feel that we'll be on a solid roadmap there as well. So that's the ranking, CJ. It's a long answer to a simple question. Thank you, Jay.","Vince anticipates a positive growth trajectory starting in Q2 2025, led by a recovery in the industrial sector due to healthy customer inventories and emerging opportunities in AI and aerospace.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"My question is on Q4 industrial and then how it sort of shapes fiscal 25. I think for Q4 industrial, if I'm not mistaken, you had expected sales to grow high single digit. I think they bent up only modestly. And then you're guiding Q1 industrial down again sequentially. So Vince, my question is industrial really out of the woods, you know, what helps it grow above seasonal? Because just assuming seasonal growth for the rest of fiscal 25 may not be sufficient, right, to really grow fiscal 25 at a strong pace. So just, you know, maybe help us understand you know, understanding what's happening in the industrial market and when do you expect it to start growing above seasonal trends next year?","So, Vivek, I'll take that one. So, 4Q, as you mentioned, was a bit lower than we expected, driven largely by weakness in the broad market and our decision to reduce channel inventory during the quarter. You know, as you know, reducing channel inventory has an outsized impact on our industrial business. At the same time, we did see continued strength in ADEP instrumentation and tests and a return to sequential growth in automation. If you remember, in the prior two quarters, we had seen significant declines in automation. So to see that return to sequential growth was a very positive sign. You know, taking a step back, we've grown industrially sequentially now for two quarters off what we said was our drop in Q2 of 24. So we feel pretty good that the recovery is still unfolding for us. And now we're in a waiting game a bit to see what the macros do. But if I look to 2025, you know, one of the important signals for us continues to be we have been undershipping demand for the better part of 18 months. You know, and if you just normalize that for even our historical patterns or the market patterns, you know, it would indicate we've undershipped something like 20%, which is how we get confidence in coming out of Q1's seasonal down. We will start to see growth again in industrial in the remainder of 25. Obviously, the slope of that recovery will be governed a bit by the macro backdrop.","The question addresses concerns about the industrial sector's growth, noting lower-than-expected Q4 sales and a sequential decline forecast for Q1, while seeking clarity on when growth might exceed seasonal trends. The answer explains that Q4 sales were impacted by market weakness and inventory reduction, but highlights signs of recovery, particularly in automation, and expresses confidence that industrial growth will resume in fiscal 2025, contingent on macroeconomic conditions.",0,3,-0.999999667,0.061224489,16,4,0.59999997,0.408163257,4,3,0.142857122,0.071428571,24,6,0.59999998,0.306122446,3,0,0,0,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Just on your automotive business, how have customer orders and pricing discussions tracked for the growth areas of your portfolio, such as A2B, GMSL, and functional safe power? And then how have they progressed for the sort of other half of the automotive business?","So I'll break that into two pieces, I guess. I'll talk about pricing first. So From a pricing perspective, so far with customers, it's been largely as expected and continuing to exhibit the stability that we've talked about previously. We continue to focus on the high end where our customers value performance versus price. We continue to command ASP's Forex, the industry average, and that has continued to grow over the cycle. Particularly as we look across our broad, large customers, we're becoming more and more important moving from a essentially a Tier 2 contracting with Tier 1s to actually partnering with the OEMs at the early stages of design. You know, and we've talked about before, prices set at the design end tend to stay pretty fixed throughout a long period of time, sometimes over a decade on average, although there is some volume discounts that come through. So we trade off incremental volume for small decreases in price. And then we do look to mitigate those discounts with our vintage increases on our older product. The other thing that's helping on the pricing stability is we are clearly broadly across costs in our business experiencing inflationary environments, which supports continued stability on the pricing side. In your comment, you asked a little about the pieces of the automotive business. You're right. We break it down into two halves. One, we call it the growth areas. Vince outlined a bunch of those. PMSL, A2B, Function Safe, Power, VMS. They make up about half our revenue in auto. Those grew in 24 over 10%. The other part of the business, the other 50%, is really a more standard product portfolio that goes across all OEMs, all customers, and really goes up and down in production. That piece was down about 10% in 24. And you fast forward to 25, we think it'll be more of the same, where we see a lot of the growth come from those GMSL ADB monthly saved portfolio. And as we","The automotive business has seen stable pricing and strong growth in high-value areas like A2B and GMSL, with these segments growing over 10% in 2024.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Vince, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on this sort of mixed environment, right? Because inventories have bottomed, you know, excess inventories have bottomed. At the same time, end demand seems to be kind of mixed. So as you navigate through, you know, this period, could you elaborate a little bit on your visibility? You know, how's backlog trending? Are you finally starting to see new products ramping more into production? Because these are typical scenarios, signals that you want to see at the beginning of a new cycle?","Yeah, thanks, Tory. Well, I'd say, I mean, first and foremost, we run this company on POS signals. That's how we plan our production, how we run the company operationally. So we pay very, very close attention to what's happening in terms of the end market demand. And, you know, my confidence has increased since last quarter that indeed 2Q was the cyclical bottom. We've exited 3Q with very, very lean channel inventory. We've taken inventory off our own balance sheet, though we're positioned with a very, very healthy backlog of inventory on our own balance sheet so that the anticipated demand upsurge that we expect in 2025, we're very, very well equipped and ready to meet that. You know, in the fourth quarter, as we've said, we expect to see continued sequential growth. And indeed, we'll also see, I think, particularly in the industrial area, continued improvement on customer inventory levels. So, look, it's all the whole recovery, you know, the ramp of the recovery will depend on the macro situation. But nonetheless, given the design wins, we've a record design win pipeline in the company. So we're facing many, many secular tailwinds with a very strong pipeline, very, very good supply line, and with a very, very lean inventory on the customer's balance sheet. So that gives me the optimism, Tory, that we're very, very well positioned coming into the new year.","Vince expressed confidence in navigating a mixed demand environment, noting that they rely on point-of-sale signals for production planning and have a healthy backlog despite lean channel inventories.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"My question is on the trajectory of automotive versus industrial. You know, it seems like automotive entered into an inventory correction a little bit later and so far has been much less severe. I guess you sort of talked about some ongoing headwinds in that space. Can you just talk about, you know, what overall drawdown might you expect in automotive and where are we in customers kind of drawing down safety stock inventory?","So, Joe, this is Rich, and I'll take a crack at that one. So just to level set a little bit, you know, from our perspective and what we're seeing in the market, cars continue to become more electric and software-defined, which is also driving our semi-content growth, largely trying to address increased battery densities, more sensors, displays. And we do expect that that is going to be a long-term tailwind to our business. However, and this is where we're starting to see some of the pullback, The vehicle market has softened in the near term. We're seeing our customers pull back on their production. And at this point, we're seeing them start to choose to burn off some inventory. So we are seeing that. The softness is evidenced in our results. Auto's been down year over year for two straight quarters, and we expect it will be down again in 4Q. And from a bookings perspective, we did see a decline in bookings in auto. In particular, we've seen inventory digestion in our legacy auto and in our BMS portfolios, and we expect that that's going to continue into at least the fourth quarter, particularly when you consider the challenging purchasing environment that currently exists for customers. However, to your question around the peak to trough, you know, unless SAR returns to, you know, to pandemic levels, you know, we don't see the peak to trough being nearly as dramatic as we saw in our other end markets. You know, the underlying secular growth trends that I described, You know, driving higher semi-content. Also, we've continued to see more penetration and value capture across all vehicle types, whether it's ICE, plug-in hybrid electric, or full electric in the fastest growing applications. If you think about that, ADAS, digital cockpit, and electrification. So, we will be down, but we don't expect that the cycle depth to be as severe as we saw, for example, in industrial.","The automotive sector is experiencing a softer market with customers reducing production and inventory, leading to a decline in bookings and year-over-year performance.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Do you think the environment allows for sequential growth to continue into Q1? You know, it seems like industrial could grow. Autos, I'm not sure, given some of the bookings commentary and consumer tends to be down seasonally. So just conceptually, how should we model the shape of this recovery into Q1?","Yeah, well, at this point, you know, it's hard to call given that the environment is still a little, let's say there's a bit of disequilibrium. But I think generally speaking, we would probably expect to see a bit of a seasonal decline in the first quarter and then bounce back in the second. I think that's the sentiment. But overall, I maintain my outlook that we will see a brisk growth here in 2025. I'll help you out a little bit on the seasonality question. It's been a few years now since we've seen seasonal trends in our business. You're right. If you look back over the past 10, 15 years for ADI, consumers are down 10% plus sequentially in 1Q. And the B2B markets of industrial, auto, and comms are down low single digits. And as Ben said, there's probably no belief today that we'd be any better than seasonal given where we are today. But we'll update you in 90 days of how we feel about 1Q. Yeah, I think the big modulator for us will be what happens in industrial in particular. And what I can tell you is that the various C-suite conversations I've had with our industrial customers would suggest that their optimism is also strong for 2025.","The respondent believes that while there may be a seasonal decline in Q1, a recovery is expected in Q2, with strong growth anticipated in 2025.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,So you were above seasonal in fiscal Q3. You're above seasonal in fiscal Q4. Sounds like you're not willing to commit that you're going to be above seasonal in fiscal Q1. The street's modeling like 5% or 6% above seasonal for fiscal Q1. Was there something that happened in bookings? Did bookings slow in the last couple weeks or the last month or something to make you not want to commit to the fact that fiscal Q1 would be above seasonal or just that it's 90 days away and you just don't want to comment on it?,"I'll start out on the street expectations and then we can rake down a little about bookings. We never got to 1Q. I think the street makes up the street expectation for 1Q. I think the street has everyone better than seasonal for a calendar 4Q or a fiscal 1Q on the hope of a snapback. I would say, yeah, there are things that have changed in 90 days, but we're optimistic about 25 as a full year. We just don't know if it's above seasonal in that outlook for a good year in 25. I'll pass it to Rich to go through some of the bookings dynamics. Yeah, so Tim, from a bookings perspective, up until Q2, as we talked about, We'd seen three straight quarters of broad-based bookings improvement. However, Q3 was different. We saw continued bookings growth for industrial, consumer, and communications, but we did see automotive orders decline, which resulted in a modest drop in our total bookings during the quarter. We did still end with a book to bill around parity. You know, and if I look at it from a geographic perspective, Regionally, bookings were the weakest in Europe. America's was modestly weaker, which offset bookings' growth in Asia.","The question inquires about the company's reluctance to commit to above-seasonal performance for fiscal Q1, despite strong fiscal Q3 and Q4 results, suggesting potential issues with bookings.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"It was good to see inventory on your balance sheet come down again, and you guys spoke to channel inventory coming down as well. As you look forward, what are your thoughts on utilization rates internally? How are you engaging with your foundry partners, and what's embedded in your October quarter outlook as it pertains to the channel?","So, as I noted in the last call, we said both utilization and, in fact, gross margins had bottomed in Q2, and that is proving to be true. From an inventory in the channel perspective, the expectation is we will ship to end demand. We are currently at the very low end of our range in the channel at seven to eight weeks. And I think we'd mentioned previously if we saw continued improvements, we would start shipping to end demand. So we will do that in the fourth quarter. Thank you.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"I had a question about the outlook for Q3, specifically in industrial. I think you indicated that you expect industrial to be the strongest performer this quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what's behind that strength between end market demand, inventory replenishment, and if there's any subsegments within industrial that's driving that outperforming growth.","Sure. This is Rich, and I'll take that one. So, industrial obviously is our most diversified and profitable end market, and it's weathered an unprecedented broad-based inventory correction over the past year. Importantly, we expect Q2 was the bottom for industrial, and it will grow in the second half starting here in Q3. Stronger PMIs are supporting the broad-based bookings we've seen for the three consecutive quarters now. And as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're planning to reduce channel inventory further in Q3 which impacts industrial more than any other market. This will be more than a year of under-shipping consumption, one reason we believe inventory headwinds have stabilized for industrial. Given these dynamics and the exciting design wins and AI-related tailwinds in our instrumentation and test business, which Vince alluded to, we feel strongly we are at the beginning of the industrial recovery.  Yeah, I think one other piece of color, Tory, is that obviously the aerospace and defense business is doing well. We've a lot of high prospects for that over the coming years. But I think in general, geographically, it's been on the upward in terms of demand and across most of the segments, particularly the ones that Rich pointed out.  And, Tori, on the outlook comment, you're right. Just to clarify what we said, of the B2B markets, industrial will grow the fastest. Consumer will grow faster than industrial in 3Q. So if you want to just kind of back it down a little bit, consumer is probably growing about 10% sequentially. and industrial is probably closer to mid-single digits, and the other two markets are probably a little bit below that industrial level, but all markets should grow in 3Q.  ---","The outlook for Q3 in the industrial sector is positive, with expectations of growth driven by improved demand, inventory replenishment, and strong performance in subsegments like aerospace and defense.

Not all applications within end markets are above one, though. And if you think about the shape of that bookings throughout the quarter, we talked about last year on this call, bookings improved. And it started below parity and exited the quarter above parity, and that's across all markets and geographies. But again, I reiterate, it's not all applications.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to ask about the back half of the calendar year and how you're thinking about the shape of the recovery.

So I'm curious if you expect this upturn to be similar to past cycles and we kind of follow those patterns or do you see anything in the marketplace today or anything from customers that would indicate, you know, something materially different in terms of the shape of the upturn?","Yeah, thanks, Ashir. So, yeah, look, first off, we believe we've seen the bottom of the cycle and, you know, As Mike indicated, the stronger PMIs that we've seen, particularly in the industrial sector, give us a lot of confidence and there's a strong correlation between our industrial business, which is about half of the company's total revenue. And as we've said now a few times, bookings and backlog coverage out for the next several months beyond this quarter would give us strong indications that we expect continued growth during the second half of the year.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"What is the right way to understand the true change in end demand if we set aside all the inventory fluctuations? For example, Is it worthwhile seeing what did distribution sell through year on year in Q2? What is the assumption for Q3? And does that inform us in any way about can Q4 be seasonal, whatever is the version of seasonality? I'm just trying to see the right apples to apples way of looking at what is end demand doing, setting aside all this inventory noise.","Yeah. Yeah, look, I think It's very hard to answer that question simply because, you know, when history is written, we're going to get the average of what's happened pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. So there's been so much ringing in the system, you know, demand overshoot and then demand undershoot. But my sense is, certainly from our perspective, I think, you know, we're very well positioned to be able to capture the upside if things grow faster than we expect. We've got a lot of inventory on the balance sheet. We've kept inventory closer to ADI, less downstream. And with the, we've got as well a tailwind here from AI, which I think is gonna be a multi-year tailwind. So we've got that pushing us along. But at the same time, we've got still, we've got high interest rates. We've got still relatively high inflation in many places. So I think ultimately, The size of the recovery and the pace of the recovery will have a strong economic and geopolitical tone to it. But, I mean, overall, my sense is we'll see good growth for the remainder of this year and strong growth in 25. And beyond that, you know, I think we've got many, many growth drivers that we feel very confident about. We're selling more value into each of our customers and each of our segments. And I feel good about the place that semis are in as an industry right now as well in terms of overall demand as the edge becomes more intelligent and the cloud builds out. But very, very hard to give you an answer on the puts and takes. The dynamics of the relatively near term are hard to decode, but what we can tell you is Given where PMIs are at, given where our demand's at, we're in a recovery phase.  Yeah, and Vince, I would add to that. While it's impossible to get perfect visibility into our end customer inventories, certainly the signals that we monitor tell us that customer inventories are much healthier than they were previously as we enter the second half. And this is also aided by our belief that we have been under shipping, under consumption for over a year now, both in the channel and directly.  But I think you have some quantification, right, of what the sell-through has been in the reported quarters year-on-year.  Yeah, I can help you out there, Rebecca. I think your question is kind of what's sell-in versus sell-through. We talked about last year, we talked about reducing the channel inventory by about $100 million. We achieved that in our 2Q. We had to do a little better than that. As you look to 3Q, we'll reduce channel dollars again, but not by that much, not nearly $100, much less than $100 million. So we're getting more normal in the channel as our weeks are coming down into our target range. So that normalization is helping some of the growth, but sell-through is also increasing in 3Q from 2Q, which is really how we drive the business and look at for the indication. As you fast-forward to 4Q, if these bookings continue, we don't know, there's no reason to think we won't be more in balance in 4Q from a ship-in versus ship-out perspective as well. And then we'll see how 1Q goes from there. So I think that's kind of the question you're asking is, There's a piece Rich talked about and Vince talked about about the customer's inventory. That's leaning out. If you look at us and what we're shipping in the channel, that's also normalizing, setting us up for a good second half in 2025.  ---","The question addresses how to accurately assess end demand by excluding inventory fluctuations, particularly in relation to year-on-year sales and seasonal trends.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Can you talk about the gross margin drivers from here, maybe touch on utilization rates and inventory trends? Some of your competitors have talked about pricing returning to historical norms. If that happens, can you still get the gross margins back to the previous peak?","Sure, I'll take that one. From a gross margin and utilization perspective, You know, we talked a little bit about this in the Q1 call. We expect both utilization and gross margin bottomed in our Q2. However, we do expect the pace of gross margin expansion in the second half to be modest, and specifically for Q3, we anticipate gross margin a bit above 67%. Looking from here, gross margin expansion is going to be dictated by continued revenue growth, mix of business, and utilization. You know, from our balance sheet perspective, since our peak in Q3, We've reduced balance sheet inventory significantly, including over $70 million in Q2. For the third quarter, we expect to reduce inventory again by a lesser amount than in Q2. Overall, we executed pretty strongly against our inventory reduction goals while mitigating the impact on gross margin,","The speaker anticipates modest gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, with Q3 expected to exceed 67%, driven by revenue growth and utilization rates.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"To this extent, you guys are guiding down now -30% year on year. If I go back to historic drawdowns, you haven't seen revenue fall that far other than 2001-2009 where we had kind of significant demand destruction. It kind of looks like the worst inventory correction we've ever seen. Can you just talk to that, does that reflect how much inventory excess there might have been, or just any kind of sense check as we approach the bottom as to why the downturn looks kind of severe?","Thanks, Joel. I think first and foremost, if you like, the event that caused the supply chain fracture was unique. Every single segment was impacted, every single customer, every single business. This is truly the broadest base demand inflection I've ever seen in my 30-something years with ADI. I've been through all those different perturbations. I think the uniqueness of the event itself, I think, is what caused the level of impact. Everything compounded. We saw the supply chain fracture, then we saw the shortage, and then we got the behavior that we typically see in a shortage situation. You get double ordering, you get hoarding, and we're seeing that everywhere. The area that we've probably seen, I would say the biggest correction is in the industrial market. I think our sense is that it began in the second half of the past year, and that will take four to five quarters to correct, I believe, from the beginning of the decline to when we start to see growth again. I think that's pretty much it. Now we're in a situation where the lead times are very uniform. We got ahead of the supply chain issues, I think, faster than most. We got our lead times back into better shape than most quite quickly. We saw the downturn, I think, more quickly than others. All that said, Joe, I think the underlying demand for our products and technologies in the years ahead, we remain very, very bullish about that. I expect, as we've indicated, that we'll see a return back to growth in the second half of our fiscal year.","The question addresses concerns about a significant revenue decline and inventory correction, comparing it to historical downturns. The answer explains that the unique nature of the recent supply chain disruptions and widespread demand inflection has led to this severe impact, particularly in the industrial market, but expresses optimism for a return to growth in the future.",0,5,-0.9999998,0.156249995,10,3,0.538461497,0.406249987,3,7,-0.39999996,0.086206896,17,11,0.214285707,0.241379308,1,0,0,2,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Rich, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the segment guide to do next quarter. I know you said everything down and industrial worse, but I mean, like, industrial's got to be down probably more than 20% sequentially, and that would probably still assume everything else is down double-digit sequentially. Is that what you have in mind? Any further color you could give us would be great.","Sure. I'll grab that one. It's Mike. So you're right to think industrial is the weakest. I would say 20% sequentially, sure, you can put that number in your model if you want to, 20% plus or minus sequentially. I would say comms is also probably worse in the midpoint of our guidance, so down more than the 16% we're guided to, while auto and consumer probably do a bit better, but are both down pretty significantly sequentially as well. And really, the big driver on the industrial piece as we laid out is the channel reduction in the, for the inventory in the channel, which is impacting industrial more so than other markets.","The question seeks clarification on expected declines in various market segments for the next quarter, particularly in industrial. The answer confirms that industrial is indeed expected to decline around 20% sequentially, with communications likely performing worse, while automotive and consumer sectors may fare slightly better but still experience significant declines.",1,1,0,0.079999997,10,2,0.666666611,0.479999981,1,2,-0.333333222,0.063829786,7,5,0.166666653,0.255319144,5,0,0,2,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"How much of this downturn do you think is just pure inventory correction versus demand, and then any comments you could have on just demand trends as far as what you're hearing from the distribution channel and your customers?","Yeah, sure. I'll start, and then I think this will add some clarity also on it, but this really is a supply-driven demand correction, what you're seeing here. And Vince outlined that in the answer to the first question, where the supply chain fracture, lead times extended for an extended period of time. Those are normalized. We're still seeing what are happening is our customers is, they build a lot of inventory over that time. Why? Our lead times are extremely long. Now our lead times are back to normal, so you're seeing them reduce their balance sheet inventory to match our short lead times so the cycle times match up. So really, I'll talk majority supply chain, some demand, and there's some areas of pockets of weakness in demand, but really overall, I'll call it more of a supply than demand correction in our business. And we talked about in the script and as well as the press release, that supplies normalizing here in our second quarter. Yeah, I think Chris, if we look at the two halves of FY24, I believe the first half is all about inventory indigestion and digestion. And as Mike said, we largely get through that part of the headwind by the end of our second quarter. And then in the second half, all the indications are bookings are getting stronger, cancellations are baiting, our conversations with customers suggest that we'll begin to return to a growth pattern in the second half. The big question is the macroeconomic dial, you know, where that's positioned. And I think at the margins, if I look at where we are this quarter versus last quarter, at least from a macro standpoint, maybe with the exception of China, we're more bullish than we were.","The downturn is primarily attributed to a supply-driven demand correction due to previously extended lead times, leading customers to reduce excess inventory as supply normalizes. While there are some pockets of weak demand, overall trends suggest a return to growth in the second half of FY24, supported by improving bookings and fewer cancellations.",0,2,-0.9999995,0.117647052,2,0,0.9999995,0.117647052,6,7,-0.076923071,0.110169491,14,9,0.217391295,0.194915253,1,0,0,3,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Vince, on the last earnings call, you mentioned bookings were stabilizing. I think this quarter you were saying bookings are improving. And I'm curious which end markets are showing the best recovery in bookings. And then importantly, how should this inform us about what ADI will see as we get into the July quarter? Should we be assuming some kind of seasonal recovery? Should we assume things flatten out first? And if I could, you know, attach kind of part B of that, which is what happens to gross margins as you start to see that flattening out and potential recovery. So just the shape of what recovery looks like in sales and margins. You know, bookings flattened and now they seem to be improving.","Yeah, well, I think, look, as soon as demand influxes and we get back into a more normalized growth pattern, Vivek, everything will improve. Our utilization will improve. We have undershipped the channel. We've undershipped our customers. So we've been working very, very hard in the company to make sure that when demand influxes, we will get a, we've got the supply in place. We've got lots of finished goods and dystock inventory. So we're in a great position to address the recovery. On the first part of your question about, you know, where are we seeing the bookings improvements? Pretty much everywhere, pretty much everywhere across all the segments. And if you look at industrial, I'd say the two healthiest parts of industrial right now as we message to the external world, aerospace and defense and healthcare, you know, they've got fundamentally quite different drivers to say the factory automation or instrumentation business. But you know, those two sectors are holding up better than the rest. But even in a more traditional industrial sector like instrumentation, all these new high-performance computing systems need new test equipment. So that benefits ADI. So I think in general, it's true to say maybe with the exception of our wireless business, most sectors are seeing a return to a more normalized bookings pattern. Yep, go ahead. And Vivek, I'll give you a little more color on the gross margin outlook. So in the last call, you know, we talked about gross margin would be 68 to 69%. We came in at the high end, a good result given the large drop in industrial that we've been talking about and with an inventory takedown of almost $90 million quarter over quarter. The 2Q outlook implies 67% plus or minus, a bit lower than what we thought would be given the weaker revenue, especially in industrial. And the fact that we're taking down factory starts further in 2Q to reduce inventory by another $50 to $100 million. And if I think a little bit further out to the half-two outlook, tough to predict, right? So the best sense right now is the revenue and the shape of the revenue recovery will be the governor on gross margin trajectory. But our best sense is gross margin trends higher in the second half as we don't see utilization going much lower as inventory continues to decline meaningfully at these start levels and will continue to leverage our swing capacity. And Vivek, as you asked a three-part question, I'll chime in as well for third quarter outlook. I knew you'd give me the outlook outlook question. And so it's hard to say, right? Our lead times are 13 weeks or lower. So we don't really have visibility into the third quarter today. But if you look back over our history over the past decade, our B2B markets are about flattish sequentially in 3Q from 2Q. Sometimes they're up a little bit, sometimes they're down a little bit depending where you are in the cycle while consumers start seeing some holiday builds kind of up, made to high single digit sequentially. So that's kind of historical context. We're not guiding the third quarter, but that's how you should frame it. Then to add on to what Vince said about bookings, bookings actually increased last quarter and the quarter before that. So 4Q and 1Q bookings both improved. And what's interesting now is look at our bookings, they're approaching parity, which is a good sign that we should see a pickup in the back half of the year.","In response to a question about improving bookings and their impact on future sales and margins, Vince noted that demand is stabilizing across most sectors, particularly in aerospace, defense, and healthcare. He indicated that while gross margins may dip slightly in the near term due to inventory adjustments, they are expected to improve in the second half of the year as utilization stabilizes and inventory decreases.",4,0,0.99999975,0.097560973,10,4,0.428571398,0.341463406,10,8,0.111111105,0.073170731,52,19,0.464788726,0.288617885,3,0,0,6,0,1
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Looks like order has been restored in the diversified analog world with looks like a very normal cyclical downturn. And with you, what you've built is a structurally more profitable company holding the low 40% operating margin line. My question is on the bottoming process. And I know we're not there yet, but can you just remind us or help us understand metrics you're following regarding cancellations, pushouts, backlogs? You did talk about cancellations, Jim. And kind of related to that is if you look at past cycles, automotive needs to go down double-digit year-over-year decline because industrials have been there. And how should we think about that?","Yeah, good morning, Ambrish, and thank you for the question. So, yeah, you know, we noted last quarter that we believe the inventory digestion issue would last two to three quarters. And I'd say, given the new information that we have, our conviction of that has actually grown. We have, through careful analysis and observation, we've seen inventory digestion accelerate at our largest direct customers across the board and across all the various segments that we support. And we're continuing to reduce our channel inventories as well. So I think, very encouragingly, Even with normalized lead times, as we've said, you know, we're shipping out kind of 95% of customer requests within a quarter, which is very, very normal. You know, we saw against that backdrop, a sharp drop in cancellations. And though the book to bill was below unity in the fourth quarter, We did see our bookings improve sequentially, so that gives us a lot of confidence as to what's going on. Regarding automotive, I'm not sure, by the way. The assumption you're making is that there could be a double-digit drop in automotive. I'm not sure about that because we know that cars are consuming about 10% more silicon per year. And in fact, we're, you know, we continue to grow in share and ASP in the car. So my own sense is that, you know, against what could be a very challenging macro backdrop during 2024, that of all the elements of our portfolio automotive, we expect we'll fare best of them all. And, you know, we still have pretty strong confidence that we'll grow in 2024.","The speaker acknowledges a cyclical downturn but expresses confidence in their company's profitability and inventory management, noting a decrease in cancellations and improved bookings.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Vince, I'm trying to reconcile the comments that were made about some stabilization in bookings. That sounds like a positive response. But I think in the prepared remarks, you also said some headwinds that could persist through the first half of the fiscal year, suggesting that April could be a sub-seasonal quarter. So I know you're not guiding specifically out to April, but what is the right way to look at the puts and takes as we think about April? Can it be seasonal? Will it not be seasonal? And also, this extra week from January, did that really give you that 7.5% pushed. So we should be taking that out of April. So any way to help us, you know, give us a sense for how the April could shape up would be very helpful. Thank you.","Yeah, well, I think it's, Vivek, thank you for the question. It's one quarter at a time here. You know, what I will say contextually is that we expect the inventory overhang to have been depleted, you know, by the by the start of our third quarter, which is in May of this year, of next year. So, you know, we still remain pretty confident about that, given the dynamics that I just outlined. But, you know, the other part of the cycle that we're really, I think everybody is seeing pressure from is the macroeconomic climate, and particularly the decline of semi-personals in China. That's the piece. I mean, that is the piece that isn't well understood. But all that said, the macro will be the governor on what happens in the second half of the year. And I think another quarter or so will give us a lot more confidence in terms of what is possible in the second half. Jim, answer as well, give you some particular statistics to underpin our assumptions here.  Thanks, Vince. Yeah, let me just speak to, let me unpack lead times a bit first. As we said, lead times are now kind of back to where they were. 95% of our products are shipping within 13 weeks. And we've seen steady improvement in lead times in both 3 and 4Q. And I guess from the refreshing side of that is from a customer viewpoint, customers have now adjusted to those shorter lead times. And our order rates basically in the fourth quarter basically stabilized, in fact, picked up in 4Q versus 3Q. So that's good news for us as the customers have sharpened their signal into us. As Vince said, our book to bill will still be low one there, but it is kind of the first signs there. Additionally, cancellations in the fourth quarter were down meaningfully for the first time in probably close to a year. And cancellations on a shorter time fence were also very, very low. So that's good for us. From a channel perspective, we're being cautious. We continue to basically ship into the channel less than ourself through, which basically will position us well for when the upswing occurs. And from an end market viewpoint, let me just close on that point. All markets in 1Q will be down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yeah, that's it. Mike, anything else?  Yeah, and it's very confusing with a 13- to 14-week quarter. You're right, Vivek. So I'll kind of add some commentary around that, how to think about that. Normally, 2Q from 1Q and a 13-week to 13-week basis is up about 5%. Given what has been said, inventory overhang and bookings getting better, It still feels like we should probably grow some, but I don't think 5% is likely. Why? There's still an inventory overhang going on. So if you think 13-week to 13-week were about flattish, plus or minus, 1Q to 2Q, that's probably a good way to think about it. That means if you include the extra week, you're probably down about 5% plus or minus sequentially. So I hope that helps, Rebecca, a little bit, because it is confusing.","The question seeks clarity on the potential seasonal trends and impacts on bookings for April, considering both positive stabilization and ongoing macroeconomic challenges. The answer indicates cautious optimism, noting improvements in lead times and order rates, but suggests that inventory overhang and external factors may limit growth, projecting a flat to slightly down performance for the quarter.",2,1,0.333333222,0.07317073,17,2,0.789473643,0.463414623,10,7,0.176470578,0.089473684,40,17,0.403508765,0.299999998,4,0,0,10,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wonder, I mean, now that you're in a revenue downturn that looks more severe than we saw the last cycle, what are you seeing in terms of pricing? And, you know, are people, you obviously raised prices during the upturn. Are people asking you to give that back? And is that a different conversation on kind of a like-for-like basis versus approaching kind of new design win activity?","Yeah, thanks, Joe. So, look, I think overall the pricing of our existing portfolio is very, very resilient, very stable. And, you know, I think something to note as well is that every new generation of product that we build is capturing more value. And so if you look at the legacy, it's very stable. You look at the legacy franchise, we've got tremendous stability. We're capturing more new value per new socket. And, you know, I don't see any particular change. We, as a company, play at the high end of the performance curve, which enables us to get this innovation premium that is a very, very critical part of our gross margin structure and our revenue growth. And, you know, our job is to continue to invest to make sure that we stay in the cutting edge and get well rewarded for that. We fight very, very intensely at the inception of new designs. But as I said in the prepared remarks, Joe, we're seeing, generally speaking, our pipeline of new product design wins as well as the more established products continue to grow quarter by quarter year over year. So I feel confident that the pricing that we have managed to increase over the last couple of years, two and a half years, that are about to reflect the increased cost of goods. We'll hold those prices. So overall, we're bullish about where we are and, you know, what the pricing environment holds in the future.","The speaker indicates that despite a revenue downturn, their pricing remains stable and resilient, with new product generations capturing more value.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I had a question on OPEX and gross margins into Q1. So you said OPEX was down slightly even with the extra week. So if I assume it was down a little bit, it would imply the normalized, like, 13-week OPEX would be running around, I don't know, 640 maybe, maybe a little lower. Once we get through into Q2 when the extra week rolls off, is that the right sort of, like, steady-state OPEX run rate to think about as we go through the year and some other drivers. And I guess if those numbers are right, it sort of implies gross margins implied in Q1 maybe a little below 70, maybe 69. Is that the right kind of level that you're thinking about as the revenues kind of drop here?","Yes, Stacey. It's Jim. Let me take that. Let me take the margin one first, and then I'll talk about the OpEx for the quarter. There's many inputs, there's many levers to the gross margin. There's revenue, there's price, there's mix, there's factory loading, utilization levels. And let me just try to unpack that a bit. Vince mentioned on the pricing side, basically that's stable. So that's not a drag to gross margins as we move forward. On the revenue side, basically we're down. The midpoint of our first quarter guide on a 13-week basis is down, approaching 30% from our previous peak. So basically, revenue is a headwind for us there. Mix, basically,","The question inquires about the expected steady-state OPEX and gross margins for Q1 and Q2, suggesting a normalized OPEX around 640 and gross margins potentially below 70.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"So I know you're not ready to call the bottom. Some industry observers would say that this sort of inventory build started maybe late 2021, early 2022. Based on your guidance for the October quarter, you sort of back to that level. So Vince, you know, you've seen these cycles, you've seen many of them, they're all different, but Just wanted to get a sense for you what you think we're getting, you know, getting close, especially given what I just said about that immune threat adjustment now sort of being complete.","Yeah, thanks, Tori. You know, when I look at this current cycle, you know, the symptoms are always the same in these cycles, but the causes tend to have different components. And I think right now there are two kind of inputs to this particular correction. I think one is the inventory indigestion that exists out there that has been building for 18, 24 months now. And the second, of course, is the macroeconomic situation, which is a major governor as well. But I think if you look at what we understand from the direct side of our business, for example, when we look at our largest customers' revenue growth and their forecasts, compared to our growth at these very same customers, you know, we believe that we've been shipping below end consumption in the third and will in the fourth quarter. So I think one way to look at this is how long will the inventory correction take? My sense is it'll be two to three quarters before we get through the inventory digestion cycle. And I think we're positioned as a company to get beyond it quite fast because we've been managing our factories very carefully, managing our inventories both on our own balance sheet as well as our distribution channel. So, you know, we've also, I think, taken a long-term view to the demand patterns of our customers. We haven't in any way forced them into, for example, long-term supply agreements. You know, essentially at this point in the cycle, that would be forcing them to take products that they don't really need. We've been managing our channel aggressively. So as I said, we're keeping more inventory in our own balance sheet. So again, we will get to distribute the supply ultimately where we think it's needed when the recovery gets underway here. So that's my sense, Tori. I mean, in the industry, if you look back to the dot-com cycle, you look at the 2008 financial crisis cycle, most of the downturns tended to last two to four quarters. So my sense is over the next two, three quarters, we begin to see a recovery here, at least on the inventory side. And then it's really a question of how does the macro economy perform?","The speaker acknowledges that while the current inventory correction has been ongoing for 18-24 months, they anticipate it will take an additional two to three quarters to resolve.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"You said that you're not ready to call the bottom yet, and Vince, you mentioned that the inventory digestion period could last for some more time. How should we think about Q1 seasonality? It tends to be down kind of mid-single-digit. Do you think we should be prepared for something different than that? And if it is worse than kind of mid-single-digit, do you still think that ADI can maintain gross margins above 70%? So just kind of puts and takes to help us align our models would be very useful.","Sure. Why don't I take that, Vivek? So first, some quick comments just to make sure everyone has the Q4 guide correct. So on the channel, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are shipping in below the forecast we have from our channel partners. So we're intentionally bringing channel inventories down to help set us up for some better strength. The included in the guide is the backlog coverage has some turns, but less than normal, given the higher level of uncertainty. So we would need some more turns and positive book to bill, which Vince mentioned is likely to be a quarter or two out. And then just from an end market standpoint, we've got all end markets down quarter over quarter. As you know, we don't guide out further than the current quarter, but some color is I think you essentially have it right. There's no reason to think that first quarter would not be down seasonal, which would call it mid-single digit quarter over quarter. But our view is going to be driven by the holidays and the customer decisions to reduce inventory as they go into the year end. So we're not at this point seeing a more meaningful step down in Q1 based on what we can know today. And I will just remember to plant in everyone as you start to model out Q1 that every once in a couple years, we have a 14-week quarter, and that will be Q1 of 24. And then on gross margins, I think we're We're actually quite proud of our gross margin story here. We've messaged a number of times that we would have the ability to maintain a 70% gross margin on a trailing 12-month basis with a peak to trough decline of 15%. Q4 is down about 17% from the Q2 peak. And while we didn't give you a gross margin number, if you impute it from the OpEx math that I gave you, you'll see that we're able to hold that north of 70, and we'll continue to work that. For Q1 gross margins, my best sense now would be that we are likely to face a little more challenge on the utilization level as we bring inventory levels down, but we have been very successful in activating our swing capacity We're actually doing about 10% better on utilizations because we have swing than if we hadn't activated it. So it's been a very powerful lever for us, and we need to see how the math on all of that works out for Q1. But I wouldn't expect Q1 to be notably different from kind of where we are for Q4.  Yeah, I'd like to have one other comment with respect to what Prashanta said. So the other side of margin is pricing, and pricing is very stable. It's very, very stable, resilient. I don't expect that to change. And, you know, our products are very, very sticky. We've got tremendous life cycles. And that part of our business, this is really a unit correction in the business rather than price or share.","The speaker indicates that while Q1 is expected to follow typical seasonal trends with a mid-single-digit decline, they do not foresee a significant downturn based on current information. They also express confidence in maintaining gross margins above 70%, despite potential challenges in utilization as inventory levels decrease.",0,1,-0.999999,0.030303029,5,3,0.249999969,0.242424235,8,6,0.142857133,0.07486631,40,15,0.454545446,0.294117645,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"I was looking at the year-over-year comms, and I'll look at TI as your closest peer rival competitor. Vince, they started going into a year-over-year decline in 4Q22, and you were just starting, and you said two to three quarters. So it In past history, this suggests that usually on a year-over-year basis, we see roughly around four to five quarters of year-over-year decline. Is that the right way to think about your business? You said two to three quarters of digestion, and I'm assuming that means year-over-year decline in reps, right?","Yeah, good question, Abhresh. So, yeah, look, I mean, comms is just a piece of ADI's overall story. We've actually seen, I mean, we've two components as well. We've got wireline, we have wireless. I would say, you know, on the wireline side of things, we've seen the malaise going back into, you know, the late part of 22, early part of 23. So that's really things like optical control for data center and carrier networks and power, you know, we've got a power business there as well. So... You know, we think we'll see that, you know, we expect to see CapEx somewhat recover in that space to be able to catch up with the needs, for example, driven by the explosion in computing power that's required to handle the AI inflection here, for example. So my sense is the wireline part will probably start its recovery in the first, second quarter of the year. Wireless is a little harder to call. It's very, very dynamic. We all know that. The developed countries, particularly in North America, 5G deployments, which have really been focused on coverage rather than capacity, they're going to be weaker than we thought. So that's probably going to give us headwind for how long, we don't know, but I think it could be several quarters during our FY24. India has been very strong this year, of course, and I think we're expecting to see more commitments to lay in both coverage and capacity in India during our FY24. So look, we've got leadership in many of these areas like optical control systems, 5G software-defined solutions. It's really a question of timing in my mind, but there's a lot of uncertainty in the communications market in totality, and particularly in wireless at this point. So hopefully that gives you the answer to your question.  Well, I was asking about the overall business, Vince, not just about the comms, sorry.   Answer: Okay. Yeah, well, look, I think, Ambresh, the overall business, you know, we see some trends, for example, that will transcend the inventory digestion problem and even the macroeconomy, areas like digital healthcare, like aerospace and defense, the sustainable energy theme that we spoke to a little while ago. So... Again, I will just reiterate, my sense is the inventory digestion problem will last probably two, three quarters, and then we'll get back into a unit volume increase from there on.","The question inquires about the expected duration of year-over-year declines in business performance, particularly in comparison to a competitor's trends. The answer indicates that while there may be a two to three-quarter period of inventory digestion affecting overall performance, certain sectors like digital healthcare and sustainable energy are expected to drive recovery thereafter.",0,3,-0.999999667,0.093749997,2,5,-0.428571367,0.218749993,1,8,-0.777777691,0.052023121,24,12,0.333333324,0.208092484,3,0,0,6,0,2
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"I guess my question really would center around the industrial strength that you're seeing in. You talked in great detail around kind of emerging new markets as well as increasing content, yet I think a lot of investors are focused on kind of declining PMIs around the globe. And so we'd love to hear your thoughts on why your business is acting so very different from maybe some of the larger macro trends and perhaps more color on how much of it is content, how much of it is maybe emerging growth areas that are not reflected in some of these PMIs would be very helpful.","Yeah, thanks, CJ. So I think first and foremost, our success isn't by dent of chance. We've been investing heavily in this market for more than a decade. It's really our focus. It's our core. It's the core of ADI. And, you know, from both an R&D and customer engagement perspective, We've been really doubling down here over this decade plus kind of time span And we've been gaining market share for sure You know we have compared to even kind of three four years ago we have we've always had a very strong position in the signal chain the kind of data path processing electronics, but we've been able to, with the acquisitions of LTC and Maxim, we've been able to bring very strong competitive power portfolios to bear as well. So I think from a portfolio perspective, we're in much better shape. I pointed out in the script as well that when we talk about industrial, it's truly the industrial sector. I know many competitors talk about other kind of you know, indescribable sectors or businesses that are not well understood, like consumer, for example, other consumers. So I want to point that out as well. We have, as I said, many secular growth drivers in play. We see the average content per dollar of capex spent increase at a pretty meaningful level. Across all the applications, including instrumentation, factory automation is changing also. It's bringing more sensing, more compute to the edge. And all of that is driving content gain for ADI. So I think they're the primary drivers of the business. And yeah, PMIs are, I would say, in the kind of retraction zone right now. But we see stabilization. And I think when China comes back as well, which is likely to happen, we believe, over the coming months, that will drive things even further into a positive zone. C.J. Prashant, I'll just put one more thing just to help folks understand kind of the breadth of that growth. All of our submarkets were up double digits year over year, and most of them increased quarter over quarter. And if you look at it by geography, We had strength in America, Europe, and Japan, again, all up double digits year over year, offsetting a weaker China. So this industrial strength was very broad-based.","The question addresses concerns about declining global PMIs and seeks insight into why the business is performing differently, particularly regarding content and emerging markets. The answer highlights the company's long-term investment in the industrial sector, successful acquisitions, and broad-based growth across various submarkets, indicating that despite macroeconomic challenges, the business is well-positioned for continued success.",2,4,-0.333333278,0.136363633,8,5,0.230769213,0.295454539,7,3,0.39999996,0.064102564,38,11,0.551020397,0.314102562,3,0,0,1,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"I actually had a pair of kind of related questions, which is how long can book-to-bill remain one before it starts to become worrisome? And usually, if I look historically for ADI, generally the second half tends to be better than the first half. What would support that view or prevent that from happening this year?","Okay, yes. So, Vivek, let me... Let me maybe take a walk through cancellations, backlog, lead times to help answer that. But I do want to clarify, you said on book to bill, our book to bill is sub one. I thought I heard you say it was one. Our book to bill is sub one. We told you that was happening a couple months ago, and I'd expect that to carry for another quarter or two as we get through this backlog. So on the backlog, we've been saying for a while now that that we've got record backlog, and we are working with our customers and our Disney partners to get this rationalized with what customers need today versus perhaps the orders that they had placed on us six or nine months ago when we had very long lead times. This progress is what is being reflected in that book-to-bill ratio below one, and I think that it'll probably be below parity for another quarter or two as we get back to normal backlog. Lead times, the supply-demand imbalance is definitely getting better, slowly, but it's getting better. We're getting more wafers externally, thanks to the hybrid model. We have the flexibility to do that, as well as the investments we're making internally, as we've talked about with our CAPEX deployment, to increase production. So we have about 50% of the portfolio under 13 weeks today, meaning it can ship within the quarter, and that's going to continue to improve through the second half. sort of given lead times falling, bookings getting higher quality compared to a year ago as customers aren't ordering for stuff way into the future, and at the place backlog, we feel this is positive for visibility and we're really getting to true demand. And anything on second half, Prashant? Because it looks more like a soft takeoff than a soft landing from the trends. So, I don't want to go out too far, but I'll just give you a couple of comments here, and if Vince wants to make any long-term comments. We feel good about the outlook for the second quarter, given the resiliency in auto and industrial. As I said, 75% of our sales come from those two segments, and we still have a year's worth of backlog. Beyond the second quarter, it's hard on the one hand. to make a call given that we have strong backlog coverage, but we also understand there's a lot of macro uncertainty out there and things are changing fast. So I'm not going to make any predictions. One area to pay attention to, and Vince made a comment on this, is China. I think we and many, many companies are watching China. If demand accelerates in the second half, given sort of the optimism on consumers and government, that would be, you know, that'd be good for a number of organizations. Vince, anything more longer term you want to add on that? I think, Prashant, we've clearly built a lot of resiliency into the way we run the company, into the business model, as well as the manufacturing operations. So who knows what the second half is going to bring? But what I can tell you is that we've been through many, many cycles before, and never have we been better positioned in our history than we are now from a portfolio, from a customer engagement standpoint. This industry is likely, it's taken us kind of 20 years to double from kind of 2000 to 2020. We've probably doubled the content that the industry builds over the next 10 years. And I believe ADI is very, very well positioned given the strength, as I said, of our portfolio, our customer engagements. and this hybrid manufacturing model that we've got in place to enable us to capture the upside and manage the downsides.","The question addresses concerns about the book-to-bill ratio and expectations for the second half of the year, particularly in relation to historical trends for ADI. The answer clarifies that the current book-to-bill ratio is below one due to backlog issues, but improvements in supply and demand dynamics, along with a strong backlog in key segments, suggest a positive outlook for the second half, despite macroeconomic uncertainties.",1,2,-0.333333222,0.142857136,5,1,0.666666556,0.285714272,14,5,0.473684186,0.076923077,57,18,0.519999993,0.303643723,0,0,1,7,0,0
"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"So on Max, and now that we're sort of moving from the cost synergies to the revenue synergies, are there any particular areas that we should keep an eye on there, whether end markets or product categories, where you expect to see that billion dollars in synergies?","Yeah, let's do that in two parts. I'll give you a little bit of context so that everyone remembers what we talked about and then hand over to Vince. We've closed on the cost synergies. We feel great about that. So we're focusing now on revenue synergies and we're tracking ahead of schedule. We think about that synergy in stages. So first we need to identify the socket. We need to win the socket. We begin shipping to the customer and then we hit volume. So we are tracking all of those stages through our internal material. As I said, Annalise gave you a target in April. to deliver a billion dollars of incremental. Vince is holding her to a higher bar than that, so she's on track to hit that one billion. And we've seen early success. I think you've heard Vince share a couple examples over the last couple quarters. For example, in our ability to cross-sell A to B, as well as put GMSL into non-auto customers, which is new. Let me pass off to Vince here for what are some of the other areas that we're thinking about. Yeah, when we announced the combination, Tory, with Maxim, we pointed out two particular market areas where we thought ADI was underweight, where power, in particular, power management was really important, power in data center, for example. You know, as the compute densities skyrocket, and in fact, in the compute area, performance and power are pretty much one and the same thing. So we have now a very competitive power portfolio that we can bring to more application-specific areas, such as data center, as well as automotive. I think a very positive surprise is that the connectivity portfolio based on GMSL, the multi-gig serial link, is that not only are we gaining more and more traction in automotive, but also we're bringing it to other areas such as industrial, as Prashant mentioned. BMS, you know, we've got 16 of the top 20 wired BMS OEMs, sockets in the top 20 OEMs. And Maxim strengthens that portfolio as well. So in industrial, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the IO-Link technology is very, very, that Maxim brings to bear is very, very complementary with ADI's data pack solution. So I think there are multiple areas. And I think the message I want to convey here is that I was always optimistic about what we could do with a greater channel, more cross connectivity to the ADI portfolio, but I'm more enthusiastic than ever based on what I'm actually observing now with the various markets and","The discussion focuses on transitioning from cost synergies to revenue synergies following the merger with Maxim, with an emphasis on tracking progress towards a target of one billion dollars in synergies.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,I'm trying to understand where is the incremental weakness? Is it limited to Asia and within Asia? Is it industrial or automotive or both? And what about a non-Asia demand? How has that changed versus what you thought three months ago?,"Yes, thank you. Thank you, Vivek. It's been a pleasure to work with you, and we still have a few quarters together. Everyone is focused on the quarter over quarter, but before I get to your answer, I do want to take a step back and look at the year over year, because I do think that tells the story of share gains and the increasing content per dollar of CapEx, which is what we believe delivers that long-term shareholder value. If you look at our industrial and auto business, they are up year over year at the midpoint of guidance. industrial, call it roughly mid-single digits, and auto mid-teens year over year. And this comes at a time when PMIs are below 50 and auto SAR is relatively modest. So while the economics and the cycle dictate the number of units our customers sell, which will impact our business, our share gains and our increasing content per dollar of CapEx is what we expect to help us outperform, which means we're going to decline less in bad times and accelerate in good times. To your specific question, China definitely was the piece of new information that has developed over the more recent period. We've had three quarters of decline in China, and we're expecting a fourth. We did see an uptick following the resumption or the return to office after Chinese New Year, but that did fade quickly. The result was we've got inventory a little higher in the channel there than we expected. Very confident that this is not a share issue. This is a reflection of what's going on in those markets, and it's broad-based across both industrial and auto. Outside of China, I'd say that industrial and auto is holding up relatively well, especially North America, Europe, and Japan. not as strong as it was prior quarter, but it's not falling rapidly. And I would characterize it more as a measured slowdown. Comms and consumer, we've been talking about those, you know, in all those geographies, those remain weak.","The incremental weakness is primarily observed in China, affecting both industrial and automotive sectors, with a noted decline in demand over the past few quarters.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"My question is on utilization and inventory levels. So could you give us a sense for where utilization is today? What's your plan for the second half? You did talk about inventory in dollar terms coming down in the second half, but if you could give us any color on the extent of that, we'd really appreciate it.","Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Tori. It's been great working with you. So as we think about inventory, inventory is going to remain higher than normal because we're keeping the channel lean. This is something we started two or three quarters ago. From a dollar basis, inventory has peaked in second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And you should see dollars start to trend down from here, given the actions that we're taking, which is both reducing our external wafer bills, which is an opportunity that we have because of our swing capacity and our hybrid manufacturing model. And that also allows us to balance out the die bank building in our internal factories with softer demand and tap the brakes on internal utilizations. Utilizations, I would say, still are at elevated levels, so we expect them to start getting closer to what we would consider normal levels in our fiscal fourth quarter. To just give a little context, in the outlook, we gave about 48.5% operating margins. That assumes gross margins come down from where they are today. That's mixed, and also it is utilization, as Prashant mentioned. And then op-ex goes up a little bit in the third quarter based on merit increase offset sum by the variable compensation. So that's kind of the math around that. And then, as you say, as you look out, utilization probably don't go higher in 4Q after 3Q. Just to kind of give you a feel for the back half of the year.","The respondent indicates that inventory levels will remain higher than normal but are expected to decrease in dollar terms in the second half of the year due to strategic adjustments.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I just wanted to come back to the backlog. And you just went through this comment a little bit too quick for me. So the backlog, as you said, 2x regular levels, but book-to-bill below, and it is where the typical coverage ranges at this point, so I was a little unsure what that means. More importantly, book-to-bill should then be trending lower as we go over the next couple of quarters. Is that the right conclusion I should take away from those comments?","What I would, I guess, let me, let's do this in two pieces. First, let's talk about our view on this correction. Obviously, no correction is the same. But if you look over at history, Amrish, most of these sort of downturns last for somewhere between two to four quarters. And it's our view that we're going to have a weakness for the second half. But a couple points around that. First, we are really seeing this as a rolling correction across the market because Obviously, no market is fully immune, but I do think that we're better positioned. Comms and consumer, I think you would agree with us, the worst is largely behind us. We've seen those correct over the last couple quarters, and we're actually being a little bit more optimistic about consumer as we go forward. Industrial and auto, we're starting to see some softness, but that's probably not going to just last a quarter. It's important to point out that we do have some areas of strength in industrial. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. And auto really is going to continue to be a function of the SAR activity. From a bookings and backlog standpoint, the takeaways you want is bookings overall continue to decrease, but they're basically sitting at about a year of revenue, the total backlog. What that means is that the backlog for the current quarter is now to normal levels, which means that we're back to a point where we will be relying on some book and chip to hit the guide, and that's back to normal pre-COVID levels. And on a book-to-bill, we're below parity, which we had said for a couple quarters now that this was coming, and that's pretty broad-based. It's sort of all markets, industrial and auto are a little bit better, but all markets, all geographies. I did call out in, I think, Tori's question that China is certainly the weakest of that.","The question seeks clarification on the backlog and book-to-bill trends, suggesting that the latter may decline in the upcoming quarters.

"Analog Devices, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Can you talk about the backlog being out over a year when 70% of lead times are below 13 weeks? I know you've been pretty aggressive scrubbing that backlog. How confident are you that that reflects And then, you know, can you sort of describe, it seems like you're still getting a pretty decent amount of bookings, considering that people have booked out 52 weeks and can get product within 13. Are people still placing orders beyond lead time to try to assure continuity?","Yeah, great question, Joe. Thank you. So first, yes, you're exactly right. When we talk about backlog being out kind of roughly a year in value, that's phased over several quarters. So we have delivery dates from customers that are in future quarters, which sort of gives us confidence to what the future looks like. And now we're sort of back to that stage that we've always operated in pre-COVID levels, where there is a percentage of the current quarter's revenues that comes from turns business. So we're back to that state of normalcy. With the lead times down as they've improved with our manufacturing capacity additions, now there's no incentive for customers to keep giving us orders out with significant advance notice. They can get most of what they need pretty quickly. And that's the transition that you're seeing being reflected in the book-to-bill rate. Again, as I mentioned, we are expecting, and Vince has talked for a couple quarters now, that we were expecting the macro impact to hit us, but we remain very confident that the content story we have is going to help mute the impact relative to others. And given our end market exposure, as I mentioned, it's sort of going to be rolling through us. Consumer and comms are largely behind us. We will see auto pressure on units. for a couple of quarters, sorry, industrial pressure on units for a couple of quarters. And auto, we can't give you a good sense of except to say we know we have a phenomenal content story growth there, and it really will depend on consumer purchases. Yeah, I think, Joe, at the margins, I think our customers have changed their behavior. You know, it used to be that the world expected to be able to operate on a very rapid turn cycle. Now, I think that will persist. But what will also persist is the change in behavior around customers aligning their longer-term demands with supply. And those are conversations that we're having continuously. So I think the behavior has changed somewhat, and perhaps we've got a new normal.","The backlog is currently over a year due to phased delivery dates, but lead times have improved, allowing customers to receive products more quickly without needing to place long-term orders.

Can you provide more color on the attribution of that bookings performance across the business? And in general, I guess when you're looking at demand into July, just any changes based on employer size or geography?","Sure. Good morning, Brian. Great to hear from you. I love talking about bookings, especially on the heels of what was truly an exceptional performance by the overall team in the fourth quarter.

In terms of the demand environment overall and what we see, What I would offer is that, you know, the HCM demand environment remains strong. One of the things that's unique about HCM is what we do is not, you know, it's not a nice to have. It's actually an imperative for a company to run their business. They need to have their associates pay. They need HR tools. And certainly it's not getting any easier, whether you're in the down market, mid market, up market, to navigate being an employer.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"And then my follow-up, just on kind of pays-per-control performance here, can you compare and contrast the pays-per-control performance in ES versus what you're kind of seeing on the same store sale PPC and PEO, and any cadence assumptions here as you go through 2025?","Yeah, Brian, I'll take that one. So as we look at Pays Per Control, we do think that the labor market is still pretty resilient. I mean, there are a number of factors that we look to. And if you look at the BLS, you look at the unemployment rate. Jolt's report came in the other day. It was down but better than expected. Labor force participation still got some room to go, et cetera. So jobless claims are kind of neither here nor there. They're benign. So we think there's still continued good strength in the market. Having said that, we do think that Pays Per Control is going to moderate, and we have said we're thinking 1% to 2% as we go forward into 2025. I would say that we do expect that the Pays Per Control growth in the PO will be lower than it is in ES. but we're still optimistic that there's growth to be had, but certainly we expect ES to be somewhat stronger than we expect PEO.","The speaker indicates that while the labor market remains resilient, Pays Per Control (PPC) growth is expected to moderate to 1-2% through 2025, with stronger performance anticipated in Employee Services (ES) compared to Professional Employer Organizations (PEO).

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Just to touch again on ES, like, I kind of want to know like how much of that strength is idiosyncratic and things that you're doing internally versus the macro. And then maybe the follow-up is again asking about the guidance and like maybe you can lay out, you know, what could go well and what could go wrong in terms of the macro, the underlying macro for the guide.","Yeah, Dan. So, you know, just to follow up on that, I would say that you could – you know, will unemployment remain as low as it has been? I think there's no indication that it's going to worsen. It's still at, you know, decade lows or comparable to decade lows. There is good strength. There seems to be good strength across the broader spectrum of new jobs. So the NAR report came out earlier today and we're seeing new jobs. So I think that we put out there a PPC growth number that's realistic. What could change that? We could imagine all kinds of macro issues, but I prefer not to do any imagining. I think we're trying to do what we can based on what we know today. So I think that what we have today is pretty good. But as I mentioned earlier to Brian's question, we certainly recognize that ES is likely to be stronger than PEO.  And Dan, if I can just add on the sales side, just with respect to are we driving the result? Is it being driven by macro? My answer to you would be both. And so I think we have a strong demand environment. I touched on that during Brian's question in terms of our offer and how squarely it fits into that demand environment. And that's really a broad-based execution across the entire business. So it's the investments we've made into our products. It's the best-in-class service. that we have. We see that in the MPS results. By the way, we see that in our retention results as well. And so I think we've been getting stronger and stronger. I think the value proposition of what we offer is an imperative for businesses. And then once again, I would say, yeah, we are executing incredibly well across the full spectrum of our sales differentiation. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I consider it to be one of the greatest competitive advantages that ADP has. Part of that is our ability to canvas the entire market. So whether a buyer is trying to buy digitally or they're trying to buy through a channel or they're trying to buy the traditional way, like we show up at every single turn and we lean right into that with the best product and the best service out there. And as a result of all of those things, I think we are executing very well.","The question seeks to understand the balance between internal strengths and macroeconomic factors affecting ES performance, along with guidance on potential macro scenarios.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to ask on competition. Some of our recent conversations with those in the industry have kind of indicated that there's been some meaningful price compression from some of your competitors, particularly in the mid and down market segments. Have you observed others getting more competitive on price or From your perspective, is it fairly status quo right now?","Good morning, James. What I would offer is it's pretty status quo. We haven't really observed any of those meaningful price compression, things of that nature. Given how much we do compete, I think we would see. I would say that there's always some of that in terms of whether it's promotions and things that all of us run at various times throughout the year, but it doesn't seem atypical for me. And obviously, you know, I've spent a lot of years watching the competitive landscape and the sales environment. So I haven't seen anything anomalous. I think the one thing that's changed specifically in the competitive landscape is us. And so when I think about our ability to execute everything I just mentioned, best product, record retention, record MPS, incredible execution by sales, I think we're stronger than we've ever been. So I'd say that's the shift. But from our purposes, it's still a competitive environment, and we lean into it every single day.","The speaker believes that the competitive pricing landscape remains stable, with no significant price compression observed from competitors.

And also, what are you seeing in the international business, and how should we think about the potential uplift there over time as as price points in lower-cost regions continue to improve?","What I would offer is that the down market had incredible strength, by the way, on top of incredible strength last year. I think I mentioned, or I did mention during the prepared remarks, we onboarded, we sold and started 50,000 new clients in small business in the fourth quarter alone. So we're officially at 890,000 of our 1.1 million clients. are in that down market space. And so we continue just to see broad-based demand. And again, we are executing very well in that. Our mid-market sales results were phenomenal. Just an incredible execution by the team. Again, our product's been getting newer and stronger. So feel really good about that. I mentioned also in the prepared remarks what we saw in the enterprise space, specifically with respect to our next-gen HCM offering. One of the reasons I'm so excited about this is that We are seeing record results. We're seeing more than we anticipated, quite significantly more than we anticipated, and we're not even at general availability yet. And what that suggests to me is that the market is ready for this offering. The market's excited about this offering. We see clients wanting to buy in the enterprise space from ADP, and we're stepping into that opportunity. So that's kind of the distribution, very strong strength. You asked about international specifically. International had a fantastic year overall. So it was really the story of four quarters. I think first quarter of last year was strong over year-on-year, first quarter, 23. Second quarter got even stronger. Third quarter got even stronger than that. And fourth quarter, you can probably guess, got even stronger than that. So overall, our international business had just a fantastic year as well.","The company experienced significant growth in the down-market segment, onboarding 50,000 new small business clients in the fourth quarter, while also achieving strong results in the mid-market and enterprise sectors, particularly with their next-gen HCM offering.

I think you see that in our revised outlook. You see that in the revision we made last quarter as well. And so just kind of remind everybody just how well retention is going. Fiscal 23 was a record. That record was really driven by the mid market and international and the down market actually did decline a bit in fiscal 23. And we expect pretty much the same outlook, if you will, for full year 24, which is why we still have a down year on year retention results. But we're incredibly pleased with overall what we're seeing with the with client retention. That's really being led by a combination of things, one of which is the investments we made into product, the record results we have in terms of client satisfaction. That in and of itself was a record in the third quarter, along with retention. So we're very, very pleased with that. As mentioned, there's still down market variability and there's down market out of business. We haven't seen it thus far this year, but we still expect it to normalize a bit further.

So certainly that's been helping and contributing to the revenue growth. And of course, what's changed since last time around, which is making us even more comfortable with saying we're going to be towards the higher end of the range is that client funds interest impact is very good.

Companies are still hiring as we saw today and they're still investing as such in people and in HCM. The call outs. I made a few of them during the preparatory marks, but it's really another down market continues to impress us this quarter, specifically in retirement services. So I'd make a call out there. It's quite fantastic to see that story and retirement services come together. We talked quite a bit about secular tailwinds in that space based on legislation that coupled with the investments we've made, been making and incredible distribution execution. Really great to see the retirement services leading the way. I think other areas that I would call out that have been remarkably strong is our mid market as well as international.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"There's one area that, you know, investors have been asking more about. And you have you and ADP have the broadest outlook with regards to the space. So I'm asking this on the call. But some people wonder a little bit about, you know, saturation. And your new bookings continue to grow. But, you know, investors are asking a little bit more about like, you know, how much room do we have for for new solutions or how many clients have already upgraded?

And as you mentioned, we continue to deliver that and the results that we see on the new business booking side. And so I think overall, there is still runway. There's still plenty of space. I think the part for us outside of our incredible distribution organization, which has always been a competitive advantage and how we go to market that distribution is also anchored to our ability to to upsell to the base. So you mentioned, you know, this ability to upgrade and how much has upgraded and, you know, are we all the way there? What I would suggest to you is we're still at about 50 percent as it relates to new business bookings coming from call it new business, net new business versus upgrades, which suggests to me that we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity even within our base. And that's a lot of the focus that we have as an organization, whether it's in the PEO getting smarter about which clients within employer services that we target to offer to the PEO or it's the work that we're doing on generative AI to try to get upsell and offering the right product to the right client at the right time. And in my mind, bending the curve and continuing to focus on attach rates, whether that's on the point of sale or on the attach at a later time, it's definitely an opportunity for us to continue to deliver bookings in a very broad market that still has a tremendous amount of opportunity for all of us.

I think the intent here was to give some very early guidance on what 25 could look like. So, you know, we still expect to see some improvements in margins. It's just, you know, do we expect to see as much of an improvement given some of the GNI pressures, expense pressures that we may see?

Can you talk a little bit about the investment there and how we should think about how that would end up unfolding? And what do you think some of the reactions would be with some of your third party partners, like you've got bank partnerships and CPA partnerships and obviously, and also, you've got the Benefit Administration partnerships. How do you think they'll end up reacting?","I'm happy to comment on Retirement Trust Services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs, I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401K plan. Given the size and scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer standalone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders in the financial services and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage these third party trustees. So for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisors and, as you said, CPAs and banks, really by taking the trust services in-house. The implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"It was noticeable that you basically are anticipating a lower level of decline in terms of the ES retention, which is coming off of record levels. To what extent is that due to an anticipation of lower levels of bankruptcies, as opposed to just the improvement that you've been seeing in terms of your client service scores?","So retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks. -to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now. One thing to keep in mind as we kind of think about the outlook is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the other record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from a specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal 19 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business and bankruptcies, having more of a material impact.

I think as we kind of put together the improvement in the pace for control and the improvement in our bookings, I think we're going to be heading towards that re acceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO. But really just trying to get the impact of those two components, those variables, those variables is really what's going to help us get that re acceleration going. Thanks, James. Just to clarify, James, the pace for control, although it's stabilizing, it's not providing any sort of upside versus our prior forecast. So bookings are going well. It takes quite a bit in terms of bookings to really drive a material change to the current year revenue, which you all understand. With pace for control still providing sequential, gradual drag, those two are sort of netting out to an inline outlook.","The question addresses concerns about changes in revenue outlook for PEO, particularly regarding timing and the impact of soft performance in professional services and technology sectors. The answer indicates that while there has been stabilization in these sectors and strong bookings for PEO, the overall revenue outlook remains unchanged due to ongoing challenges in pace for control.",0,0,0,0,2,4,-0.333333278,0.222222214,8,3,0.454545413,0.129411763,18,14,0.124999996,0.376470584,1,0,0,2,0,0
"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"Quickly on AI, it seems like there's a little bit of incremental investment there and certainly a big focus on this call. But I'm wondering about how we should think about how you're anticipating a return on that investment and over what kind of time frame and maybe more qualitatively, what kinds of paybacks, whether it's increased customer satisfaction or internal operations, et cetera.","Yes, I'll start on the on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in three buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycles. So that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation philosophy and launches of products. Right. So some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP assist into into the market in a meaningful way. So product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP assist now more broadly deployed across the product set. And we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency. And this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient and giving those same tools to our associates. And so we have agent assist. I'm pleased to say that from an agent assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall, specifically a big piece of that is anchored in agent assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Zahn comment on investments and return, but just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here, you know, that the feedback we're getting from our associates is there times we're shaving off a minute or two minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seems miniscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here and a minute there and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time. Right. So we continue to lean into a service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least, by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic. But last but not least and very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go to market motions. And so we have for years been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. You know, we have partnerships that are two decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best in class modern distribution in Salesforce. And this is no different for us. We already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of generative AI, many of which are through our best in class vendors and partners that we have. And we're seeing great impact there. You know, things that I used to do myself at a personal level manually, such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting. These are big items for us as it relates to our go to market motions. And we've just started scratching the surface. So all in really excited again, just kind of wrap it all up. I think it's about product service efficiency and our go to market motions. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don, who can kind of talk about how we're","The question inquires about the anticipated returns on investments in AI and the time frame for these returns, focusing on qualitative benefits like customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The answer outlines three main areas of investment: product innovation, service efficiency, and sales modernization, highlighting the positive impacts on client experience and associate productivity, while expressing excitement about the potential long-term benefits.",1,0,0.999999,0.030303029,7,1,0.749999906,0.242424235,21,2,0.826086921,0.085501858,89,17,0.679245277,0.394052043,3,0,0,4,3,0
"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe first just one to double-click on the PEO side. I think that the information you gave helps to understand some of what happened in the revised guidance, but maybe just help us understand what's giving that back half ramp confidence, especially as you expect pace for control in the kind of broader macro to continue to decelerate where should we get the acceleration in the PEO WSCs? Is it purely based on bookings ramping? Is it based on an expectation that the base will stabilize? Maybe just dig into that a little bit further because they're moving in different directions.","You bet. So good morning, Samad. It's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO call it double click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So as mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pace for control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a byproduct of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to, as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services technology. The pace for control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pace for control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of contributions, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below where we had hoped for, so it was still higher than overall employer services. It was a good quarter for the PEO, and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half. That coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it a couple years ago in the last year or so. And as such, as those Compares continue to lap, coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will, versus stabilize, we will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings, and that's really why we anticipate the Worksite Employee Guide for the year that we've given.","The question seeks clarification on the confidence in the PEO's growth despite a deceleration in broader macro conditions, particularly regarding the sources of expected acceleration in Worksite Employee growth. The answer explains that while there has been a deceleration in PEO growth, strong bookings and stabilizing retention are expected to contribute to a reacceleration in the latter half of the year.",3,0,0.999999667,0.062499999,12,4,0.499999969,0.333333326,5,2,0.428571367,0.056910569,22,6,0.571428551,0.227642275,4,0,0,1,0,0
"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Great, and Maria, I actually had a follow-up for you as well on the international side, after seeing the rollout of the product into Ireland, and I'm just curious, how should we think about the expansion beyond the U.S.? I know ADP already has a presence and it's a meaningful contributor to revenue, but just should we think about international maybe being an offset to some of the slowdown that we're seeing in U.S. revenue? Just how should we think about the cadence and impact as you move more international with your core HCM solutions versus just helping U.S. employers that already had an international presence?","Yeah, absolutely. So I'll speak to roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun intended, our roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very, very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple weeks, but we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking this call it very down market offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product with what we see as still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have. That's everything from distribution to all the services, call it, around the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out, roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even roll over time this year, I think it would be, you know, not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned is this companies that have a presence in Europe that exist in the U.S. with But, you know, folks working in or call it in international. And the answer is this is both that coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best of breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international. And that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of role. So we see it in the SMB space. We see it in our best of breed space. And we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while I'm on international, I thought I would just mention, because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering.","Maria discussed the recent rollout of their product in Ireland, emphasizing that while it's early days and the immediate revenue impact is negligible, they view international expansion as a long-term investment with significant growth potential across various markets.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"So, Marie, I was hoping if you can comment on just how you're seeing the overall macro situation evolve and maybe how that may affect demand. And if you can specifically unpack that within the ES segment, maybe talk about some of the areas that came in better than you expected versus any areas that may have been lighter or downtick versus the prior quarter.","Absolutely. Good morning, Brian. So, happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the the overall performance of bookings, but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments we did see strength, continued strength in our down market. I was really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance, tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to new business bookings. Those are the two that really outperformed. It's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering, and that's everything from our run offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the finish last year. And it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that, well, good performance makes me happy regardless, but it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments, both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there. and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our four-year guide, so excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment, and I feel like I've been saying this quarter to quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still strong. Demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines in the up market and the mid market. Certainly in the down market, we're looking at things such as the new appointments and kind of activity, excuse me, activity measures to really, you know, give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you pipelines are healthy year on year and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, kind of the opposite, stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September. We feel really good about where our pipelines sit year on year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always, though, Brian, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes coupled with any demand environment that could shift, given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipelines, demand, and the quarter.","Marie discussed the strong performance in bookings and demand for their down market and compliance solutions in the first quarter, noting that overall demand remains healthy with no significant changes.

Certainly, macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, I think the odds are now not for a recession. So soft landing is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the U.S., so I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had, in fact, contemplated the slowing in pace for control growth Maria mentioned that and talked about that in the PEO business, but we are confident. We are still seeing growth, albeit we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously, but once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year.","The response highlights a generally positive macroeconomic outlook, with low unemployment rates and no anticipated recession, while acknowledging a slower growth pace in the ES segment compared to previous expectations, which was already factored into their original guidance.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I was just curious more on kind of your PEO revenue guidance.

I was just curious if you can provide any more color on that spread, if it's any conservatism or if there are any other factors to consider there.","Hey, Owen, thanks. Yeah, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think, as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there's a challenge that we're facing a little bit, as we're seeing a little bit softer pay-for-control growth in the PEO, then we would have expected.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Maybe first question, Maria. I thought it was very interesting about the announcement of moving a role into new international markets. How should we think that may be what the opportunity there looks like? How much different is the complexity around payroll processing in international markets versus the U.S.? And have you included that in the bookings forecast for fiscal 24?","Yeah, fair enough. Thanks, Samad, and I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're obviously pretty proud over here. So, With respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to roll out, no pun intended, across the down market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into two countries, and it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these two countries. We're thinking more kind of the down market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about Roll long-term beyond that space, and so excited to dip it into our international space as we continue the overall rollout of Roll. In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think by the time the launch happens, and as we're thinking about the full year for international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent. But to us, it's really about the long-term value that that offer will bring. as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places. Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international, and I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks, there's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there's complexity country by country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex here in the U.S. to shame in terms of the complexity that that provides, and that's Everything from government entities, legal and tax attorneys, who is the tax authority and how do you get to them? We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity, and that's what we've been building over the last couple decades in our international business, so it's a lot more then dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it. Again, whether it's tax authorities, data lodgement, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our products into that footprint as we expand role internationally.","Maria discussed the exciting opportunity of expanding their product, Roll, into international markets, particularly targeting the SMB space in two countries.

I think, once again, in prepared remarks, we called out our tax business and our international business, so they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong, and the Dow market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the board in the fourth quarter. We talked for some time about how the pipelines were healthy and whatnot, and you've had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, etc. Things came together in the fourth quarter, and we were very, very pleased with the final result. That's right. My only add to that comment would be we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines, with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you, when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, You have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming, and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to follow up on ES Bookings here. So you cited several areas of strength. I heard Mid-Market Compliance International. On the mid-market specifically, can you talk about what's driving that better than expected performance? Do you think that's driving improved competitive performance versus kind of rising tide environment? And then just heard you comment on NextGen HCM contributing more in the current fiscal year to bookings. Maybe talk about the initiatives and the product development that you think is going to drive that.","Fair. Good morning, Brian. So I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and it coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings. And as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have. I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. We do have our next generation payroll engine, that the Salesforce is pretty excited about, and we're seeing that in the wins that are coming in, and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to. And I think the other call-out is, you know, it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective when the business on the other side, so service and PS, if you will, as well as retention, are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record MPS results across the mid-market, so really, really proud of the execution in that entire space, and that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go to market. Stepping into the question around next-gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation. And that's exactly what we've done in that business. So we were able to onboard a lot of the clients that we had on our backlog. We've shortened via the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog, so we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that next generation HCM platform, so we're really excited about the momentum as we step into 24, and as such, we believe that NextGen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming year than it was in 23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in.","The mid-market's better-than-expected performance is attributed to strong HRO offerings, significant investments in product development, and high retention rates, which have energized sales efforts.

So as we've talked many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So we did get about 150 basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a client retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well. And we're very happy with how that transpired throughout 23. For 24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points.

It's still early. We're still in the middle of our planning process. I think we have a lot of things going in our favor still. We still have relatively high client-front interest. Pays for control have been good and strong. Bookings continue to be strong, as we said earlier. So as we get into 24, I think we're going to be in the pretty healthy spot with what we know today. I guess the challenge we all have is trying to guess what's coming in terms of the broader macro situation. You know, we continue to see strong demand. Retention continues to be pretty good, although it's normalizing a little bit in the down market as we did expect. But I think things feel pretty good at this juncture.

Can you just talk about what you're seeing in kind of the pays per control versus the retention aspect in the PEO? And with bookings reaccelerating, how long does the reconnection to improve growth take.","So we did have, as you mentioned, we had a particularly strong PEO bookings month in March, which we're optimistic is going to continue and help us as we go forward. Certainly, we're going to have to see how those bookings continue through the balance of the year, trying to anticipate how those are going to actually result in revenue. Things do start relatively quickly in the PEO business, but it's going to take some time, once again, to see how that stuff rolls from bookings into revenue. But we're pretty optimistic about how things went in the third quarter, especially with the finish, and we do expect to see that reacceleration as quickly as we want to.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Yeah, I think, Brian, if I can just comment on the quarter-over-quarter real quick, as I think you mentioned the sequential growth, Q2 to Q3 in works on employees. That is something that obviously we notice as well, and as Don mentioned, from a medium-term perspective, we are definitely still committed from the medium term to the works on employee growth that we have guided to for that. However, as it relates to kind of the quarter-over-quarter, we notice the same thing that you noticed, And obviously that's not the ideal situation, and we're hopeful that won't be the case as you look sequentially on the quarter to quarter, Q3 to Q4, but also year on year. And I think that's really a byproduct of timing, and that timing is really about retention, right? So it's really about, call it third quarter retention results, which we cited before were a bit softer than we expected. And as a result of that, you see the sequential piece to the quarter on quarter.","Okay, is that just a function of the type of client within PEO? In terms of the type being? More white collar. I don't know that it's a function of more white collar. I think it's really a function of some of the feelings that we have post-pandemic as the renewals have really been kind of rippling through the business of the PEO. So it's really a byproduct of some of the post-pandemic impact that we saw in the PEO. So it's really byproduct of the retention softness that we saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter, and then quarter on quarter this past quarter. So I don't think it's necessarily a byproduct of, because retention, you know, continues, albeit it's normalizing a bit in the down market. We do have very strong retention in the mid market. We also have strong retention, albeit, you know, tiny bit less than last year in the down market. So I don't really think it's a byproduct of the client base. or white-collar, I think it's really a byproduct of kind of a post-pandemic environment in the PEO.","The discussion highlights concerns about sequential growth in employee retention from Q2 to Q3, attributing the decline to softer retention results and post-pandemic impacts rather than the type of clients served.

So just trying to understand the puts and takes there for the fourth quarter guide versus the strong results in the third quarter.","Yeah, no, thanks for the question. You know, the biggest impact I guess in terms of growth would be we are going to continue to see strong growth from client fund interest in the fourth quarter, but certainly Q3 is by far the strongest quarter, just given the seasonality of tax receipts, et cetera, for us.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then on the booking side, although bookings were strong, I think you commented maybe towards the lower end of the range of six to nine. And just can you help us maybe think about how bookings will translate into future revenue growth for the employer services? You can just remind us just as we get our model set or start thinking about fiscal year 24.","Yeah, so I'll let Don comment on how the bookings kind of relate to the models on the revenue side. But from an overall bookings perspective, what we cited in the prepared remarks is that we do anticipate the middle of the range. So we did keep the range constant. So it's constant with the outset of the year. It's also constant with last quarter's guidance. So we are keeping that six to nine range. We do anticipate at this point, the middle of that range. And we feel pretty confident heading into the fourth quarter when we take a look at how we exited March, but also taking a look at the number of sellers we have, the investments we've made into the ecosystem. And as those sellers ultimately gain tenure, because we're actually laughing a lot of new hires that we had, if you will, a year ago. So pretty excited as we step in. The other part of that confidence is really about what we're seeing as it relates to a Overall pipeline, so pipelines are strong. That's more of a, call it enterprise and international or large deal type of comment. We're seeing tremendous activity in the top of the funnel, still up market. So the down market continues to shine for us. And that's really supported by what we're seeing in continued increases in new business formations. We're also seeing those new business formations generate inbound leads. So we're seeing good activity on the digital side. So feel confident as we... step into the fourth quarter, and then I'll let Don comment on how the ultimately where we land in the fourth quarter and how that translates into revenue for us next year.  Yeah, so on the modeling side, roughly a 1% change in ES bookings growth impacts us in the $17 to $20 million annually on revenue growth. So that's kind of how I would think about your models. I think that's been pretty consistent.  Yeah, and Brian, the timing is Depends on the business. Obviously, strong performance in the down market will impact revenue much more quickly. And if you have strong global view sales at the other end of the extreme, that can take several months to even more than a year in some cases to roll in. So typical rule of thumb for us is a couple quarters to see the full impact. But, of course, the bookings throughout the year have been pretty consistent for us, and so wouldn't expect any real call-outs from the revenue timing standpoint.","The question inquires about how strong bookings will influence future revenue growth for employer services, particularly for fiscal year 2024.

But the question is, is there a path for mid-market to get to as strong of a point as down market? And what are the levers that maybe you're able to pull to get you there?","Absolutely. So I'll start with the down market just to kind of reiterate the strength we're seeing there top of funnel here. So we are very pleased with what we saw in the performance of the down market. That's also inclusive of the down market ecosystem. So I think this is our run platform. I talked about the third quarter onboarding 60,000 clients. That's pretty incredible.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"On PEO, you mentioned lingering effects from the pandemic as having an impact, but I was just curious, is the macro environment and, I guess, labor market trends impacting PEO differently than ES? Is it a question of sensitivity to small versus large market clients? Is it vertical exposure, or is this really something you see as quite transient?","Thank you, Ramsey. Appreciate the question. So I'll try to cover all the ground on the PEO that you asked about. Specifically, what we saw with respect to the first half, we did see, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see that booking did come in softer. We saw that retention came in a bit softer as well than our expectations. In terms of the lingering effect that we cited, all of our businesses had an impact from the pandemic. I would say the PEO is probably the one that had the most impact. If you think about all the drivers that constitute the PEO, it's everything from average wages to worker mix to State unemployment to certainly the lines of insurance, workers' compensation, and health benefits. So I would say it's the business that had the most impact as the pandemic came into the business. And as the pandemic is flushing out, it is having a lingering effect on the business. I think you touched on what we're seeing with respect to Pays Per Control in the PEO in the context of ES. What I would say is Pays Per Control is the growth rate is decelerating in the PEO. That was expected. It did contribute to the slider stopper performance in the first half and is contributing to the second half. But the two main drivers really behind the performance in the first half as well as the outlook for the second half are bookings and retention. One thing I would say, though, because I want to go back to the strength of that business, we have incredible faith in that business as it relates to the growth from a long-term outlook perspective. The demand is still there in absolute form from a bookings perspective. The PEOs did have growth year on year, albeit it was softer than ES and softer than our expectations.","The question inquires about the impact of the macro environment and labor market trends on PEO compared to ES, particularly regarding sensitivity to client size and vertical exposure.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"You know, tech layoffs have been, you know, tech sector layoffs have been in the headline recently. I know you guys have a very diversified business, but I thought I'd ask anyway. How exposed are you to that particular vertical? Are you feeling any kind of acute impact from all those headline kind of layoffs in the technology sector?","Yeah, Randy, it's a good question. I think it's hard to avoid all the headlines that we're seeing day in, day out. And it's fair to say that there's been a number of large names that have announced major layoffs. I'd also have to say that some of those clients are – or some of those people – making those layoffs are our clients, but those layoffs that are happening around the world in some cases, they're not necessarily our clients in all of our markets.

I think you called out international as coming back strong versus last quarter and also down market. Can you talk a little bit about the mid-market How are the trends there? And yeah, I think the key question in everybody's mind is, are you seeing any signs of macro pressure on bookings as companies potentially pulling back their tech spending?","We were very pleased with our overall new business booking for the second quarter. Definitely saw an acceleration in pipelines. I'll get back to pipelines in a minute. I did cite the down market. The strength that we're seeing in the down market, and that's really our entire down market portfolio. So thinking about our, obviously, our run offering, but all the things that Heather offers the run offer, which is the retirement services that I spoke to at length during the prepared remarks, insurance services. We did see strength in employer services, HRO. And then last but not least, one of the things that I was most pleased to see was the bounce back in international in the second quarter, both in pipelines as well as results. And that was, as mentioned, really in our global view space. So very happy with the results, very happy with the strengthening of pipelines. That's what gives us confidence. Stepping into the back half, as we think about heading toward our guidance of 6% to 9%. In terms of... I think you also wanted to know about the mid-market because I didn't cite that specifically. We have very solid, yeah, very solid mid-market sales and we continue to see the demand there as a byproduct that is certainly not getting easier for anyone to be an employer, but from a legislative perspective as well as a talent perspective, we have incredible strength in that business as it relates to the product investments we've made. So think about user experience to what we're attaching with the next generation of payroll engine. So we make good product enhancements. We have strong NPS. We have incredible retention results. So the mid-market in general had also a solid sales performance. What I would say is as you contemplate the mid-market, don't forget that employer services HRO, the offer that we call comprehensive services, sits squarely in that market. And that's an area that experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic. And that growth has has sustained and is exceeding the overall employer services growth. So altogether, the net results for the mid-market are very, very solid for us.","The company reported strong performance in new business bookings for the second quarter, with notable growth in international markets and solid mid-market sales driven by product enhancements and strong demand.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"A quick follow-up for me on pace per control. Your number was very strong this quarter, we thought, outperforming your expectations, but also keeps outperforming by 0.2, kind of the broad measures of labor market growth in the U.S., like non-farm payrolls. And remind us, what's the driver of that and how sustainable is that as the overall labor market slows down? Can you maintain that one to two point premium?","Yeah, that's a good question. But just to remind everyone that that number is really a mid-market number. So we focus on the mid-market when we provide that pace per control number. And it has been strong, as I mentioned in the earlier answer, with respect to the macro environment. The labor market continues to be strong. We're continuing to see our existing clients add employees. As Maria said, bookings are strong. And I think it's kind of the $64,000 question about how long the labor market can continue to grow or unemployment can stay so low as we look at some of the headlines and will those things start to converge at some point in the future. But for now, I think we're comfortable with what we've done in terms of taking up the pace for control growth for the back half. And, Eugene, just to your point about that spread having existed in the past, I think typically we would have expected 2% to 3% paid-for-control growth in a normal economic environment, and that compares to maybe 1% to 2% total employment growth. And there's a function of our clients in general being perhaps a bit healthier than the overall economy, but also the fact that total labor includes things like bankruptcies, and new business formations.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"I wanted to quickly just revisit a little bit, and I think you touched on it, but retention and You know, it's an area where we had at least been expecting to see some normalization, especially from a company perspective, but it seems to continue to improve or tighten. Obviously, you made technology advancements, et cetera, but what are some other areas, if any, that you'd point to that are helping drive that retention performance?","Sure. Thanks, James. With respect to retention, we are very, very pleased by the strength that we've seen year to date. We cited at the end of the first quarter, we had record retention. The second quarter was near record. If you look at the first half, it was a record. So we're very proud of the, not to be a broken record, but the record retention and the strength that we saw. And we believe that You know, it is a byproduct of the investments. I alluded to the investments we've made into the mid-market. As an example, the user experience, that's broad-based now across the Run platform, our mobile app, our international offer, where we're also an international seeing record retention. So we believe a lot of these things are anchored in just really driving a better user experience, driving the product into a better place. I think the other is NPS. We have strong service results. That's broad-based across the portfolio. I think we generated a tremendous amount of goodwill and value during the pandemic and how we chose to service our clients. And I think that value has continued, and we see that in the results on the NPS side. So I think that's another place. You did touch on normalization. I think it's an important point to make.

"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"I just had a question as it relates to bookings trends. I certainly see that, you know, the outlook is held steady, and I know that we're kind of early in the selling season, but if there's any, just wondering if you could put any color on any differentiating trends you're seeing at this point of the year, maybe perhaps versus, you know, the last year or two, maybe attach rates or on ancillary modules or even going to more outsourced models, seeing any changes in behavior there. And then as it relates to the pricing discussion that we just had, do you feel like you have any more room? It seems like your clients are responding well and things look good, but do you still, do you think that there's potentially upside to the pricing strategy?","Thank you, Pete, and thank you for the well-wishes. Certainly appreciate them, and as you mentioned, look forward to connecting with many of you around strategic vision going forward. With respect to bookings and really thinking through year-on-year changes in behavior, I'll comment on that, and then I'll turn it over to Don that can talk about whether or not we have more room on price. But again, just to kind of confirm the overall outlook at 6% to 9%, we do feel confident in this outlook when I think about how we planned for the year. And we were generally pleased with the results that we saw in the first quarter. In fact, they were actually technically a record from a year-on-year perspective. But the thing that makes us not necessarily call that out in that way and really speaking to the continued momentum to your question is really about, in the context of the records that we've had in the past few quarters, it's really been broad-based across every bit of the portfolio. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, this morning, we had significant strength in our down market offerings. Really pleased to see that across our run portfolio, the small business segment, inclusive of our insurance offerings, retirement offerings. We also continue to have significant strength in our HRO offerings, inclusive of the PEO. So in terms of changing behavior, I see that as constant behavior as it relates to those are businesses that have had continued strength over several quarters and the value proposition, both down market and certainly into the HRO space, has been good. I think the area, again, that we called out a little bit that we're keeping an eye on is really our international business. Now, the good news with our international business is that it's a small contributor to our overall bookings, but when we look at what really happened with the international space specifically for this quarter, we don't still actually see a macro impact. We see more of an impact of the strength that we had coming into or coming off of a record Q4. And so when you think about our upmarket business, specifically our international business, You know, there are times that it's a bit lumpy as we pull deals forward to accelerate through the fourth quarter. And candidly, who wouldn't want to have an incredible finish and an incredible fourth quarter? But as it has for several decades, I would say that does sometimes lend itself to some of those businesses needing to continue to rebuild the pipeline. So that's really what we think is happening. But at the same time, you know, we're very... We're keeping an eye on specifically in Europe what's happening in the Ukraine, what's happening with the energy crisis. Those are watch items for us, but just to kind of reiterate, we don't see any macro overall trends. We don't see changes in behavior. We see the strength continuing in the down market and into our HRO and PEO offerings, and we were very, very pleased with the results this quarter, and they are record results in that respect.  Yeah, and with respect to the pricing, we've been very happy with our ability to execute the price increase in the way we did. And as we've said on prior calls, we're mindful of the fact that these are incremental costs for our clients as well, and we need to be competitive. So we've made sure that we've price increased and passed on the costs we have in a way that keeps our customers with us for a very, very long time. Having said that, we set 100 to 150 basis points, and I would tell you that currently we're pushing towards the upper end of that range in the price increase. So we've done very well against expectations and executed, as I said, well across the business. Of course, is there more available? Good question. If we look at our client base, particularly with the large clients, we do have contractual obligations that come to become due from time to time, and a number of those are tied to various price indices, et cetera, so that limits the ability to do anything beyond some of the pricing indices that drive or undermine or underlay, if you will, the pricing we have. But I guess I would say we've been very happy with where we are now, and we'll always look to see if there's an opportunity, but I think that we want to make sure and we will continue to make sure that we do what's best for ADP and in the long term as opposed to being too overzealous, if you will, with short-term pricing increases.","The question inquires about current booking trends compared to previous years and the potential for pricing strategy adjustments.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, maybe just to start with you, you talked a little bit more about generative AI on this call, which was great to hear. Maybe just to make sure the question is asked, can you just talk about what your sort of core engineering customers are saying about generative AI? And I'm sure it's a very long discussion, but how do you think about the value that Autodesk can provide sort of on that journey?","Yeah, so first off, let me make it clear that, you know, it's our intent to be the market leader in generative AI, just like we were in generative design over 10 years ago. So we intend to lean into this pretty heavily. Our AI lab has been in existence since 2018. It's been where some of the core research that's contributing to some of the things I talked about in the opening commentary came from. But also, we've been delivering AI in our product for several years now. It's a compelling way. We just released... drawing automation into fusion, which allows people to automate manufacturing drawing stacks, which is a very labor-intensive effort, and it's a high productivity driver for our customers. So in terms of what our customers are saying to us, they're looking for the productivity increases. They're asking, what are they going to look like? What kind of productivity increases are you going to deliver to this? And how are you going to use our data to deliver those productivity increases? Now, In terms of how we're going to do this, there's two avenues that we're going to be approaching here. One is going to be more disruptive to how our customers work, and the other one is going to be basically automating the capabilities and workflows they have today. We have to do both. Both have different value levers. Both will have different adoption curves. Some of the things I talked about in the opening commentary about some of our new tools for generating 3D models from photographs or for incomplete 3D models, those are disruptive approaches that set up initial model ideas for our customers and allow them to do things initially with a blank slate kind of concept where they create a model from specifications and requirements. We haven't released any of that yet. We will at some point release that to a private beta, but right now it's just something we're really proud of and we think is really important. That's an important disruptive technology. The other technologies are also going to look a lot like what we did with fusion drawing automation. They're going to be tools that take the complexity of delivering and creating a 3D model and all of its outputs to a process and take it from months to weeks or sometimes even days. And that's going to make customers who are currently using these tools, maybe slower in the adoption of more disruptive tools, incredibly more productive. Both avenues are valid, both are important, and both are areas that we're focusing on.","Andrew emphasizes Autodesk's commitment to becoming a leader in generative AI, similar to its past success in generative design. He notes that customers are seeking productivity increases through AI, and Autodesk plans to deliver this by both automating existing workflows and introducing disruptive new technologies.",1,1,0,0.066666664,7,4,0.272727248,0.366666654,1,7,-0.749999906,0.049079754,39,11,0.559999989,0.306748464,2,0,0,2,0,2
"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Debbie, maybe for my follow-up for you, Autodesk obviously provides a lot of value to its customers, which you're also able to capture as well. Maybe the question is, can you just talk a little bit about some of the recent pricing actions that have been out there and what sort of customer behavior that might drive as a result? I think there was a little bit of difference in pricing sort of between one-year and multi-year subscriptions. How do you think about that impacting the model, if at all, going forward?","So let's start first with what we did. So there's a couple of things that are going on. We did about a three-point increase for market factors, and then we did a 5% increase for renewals. With market factors, this is something that we've been talking about for a while. Our goal is to streamline pricing around the world. And then for the renewals price change, before the increase, we had a 10-point price differential between new and renewals. And with this move to agency or the move to the new transaction model, we don't see as much of a need for that delta. In Q4, what we did was we moved up the timing of the price increase so that we could better sequence things with the new transaction model coming. And that led to some early renewals down the stretch. That's part of what gave an extra point of growth to current RPO. But the price increase overall was most helpful to billings, but it wasn't material to revenue and free cash flow.","Debbie discussed Autodesk's recent pricing changes, including a three-point market increase and a 5% renewal increase, aimed at streamlining global pricing and reducing the differential between new and renewal subscriptions. These adjustments led to early renewals and contributed positively to billings, though they had a minimal impact on revenue and free cash flow.",0,1,-0.999999,0.032258063,4,8,-0.333333306,0.387096762,1,0,0.999999,0.016949152,8,5,0.230769213,0.220338979,3,0,0,1,0,0
"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"Maybe on the transactional model, and thanks, guys, for all of the disclosures around it, maybe talk a little bit more about the learnings you have from the early customer and partner feedback in Australia and And even now that you have the early days of this direct relationship, anything interesting there that you're learning from your more direct relationship with customers, be it usage or adoption or expansion that you clearly didn't have before with the prior model?","Yeah, thanks Adam for that question. First off, let me just reinforce something here. So I want to make sure that we're all on the same page here about why we're doing this, right? This is a critical part of a relentless ongoing modernization of Autodesk business, getting us ready for the long term success we expect in a world of AI driven cloud based solutions for design to make life cycles, right? It's a necessary step in this. It's the last big one in our journey of all the ones we've done at this point. And it really has some big benefits for our customers long term. One, it's going to allow us to understand them a lot better in ways that we can't currently understand them because we don't have the full account record of what the customer is doing. Two, it's going to allow us to deliver a lot more self-service capability to these customers. And three, it's going to turn our partner channel into design-made collaborators and consultants for our customers with their own unique IP and their own services and away from transaction partners. So it's critical that we kind of get on the same page of that. With regards to Australia, we actually did learn a lot, mostly about the transactions at this point because it was only for a quarter and a little bit. It didn't necessarily have direct impacts on customer behavior. But what we did learn, we've now put into the process. In fact, we actually delayed our U.S. rollout by 30 days. Based on some of the learnings during the Australia process, we changed our roadmap for some of the capabilities, updated and upgraded some of the capabilities in the transaction systems to kind of correspond with some things we saw in Australia. And we also kind of delivered some new enablement materials for partners and, frankly, for customers as well, so that they understand how this transaction model impacts their relationship with Autodesk. So we definitely took the learnings to the bank to make sure that we were better prepared, and we even gave ourselves a little bit more time based on what we learned to finish up a few things that we think are going to be impactful.","The speaker emphasizes the importance of transitioning to a direct relationship model for Autodesk, which will enhance customer understanding, enable self-service capabilities, and transform partners into collaborative consultants.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2024,Technology and Communications,"And maybe just as a quick follow-up, you know, you talked about some success with state DOTs. As you think about kind of the infrastructure bill and the stimulus that continues to be deployed, maybe just give a quick update on Innovize and just a quick State of the Union there and and the opportunity as part of the broader infrastructure push.","yeah so you'll you'll probably hear us use the word name intervise a lot less and talk a little bit more about autodesk constructions or water solutions moving forward all right so i just want to be clear about that uh water is and has been a big part of our eba successes uh larger customers are adding water solutions i think there's an obvious reason for that uh you know water is just as important as it was before if not more so I think you're probably aware that in California, we just had yet another kind of flood where people didn't expect to have floods in San Diego. And that's all because water management infrastructure is moving water in the wrong places. So people need to build and rebuild water infrastructure of all types. Water scarcity, water purity, all of these things. Water is going to be a big business moving into the future. and it's continued to enhance some of our EBAs with that respect. Since you mentioned infrastructure in general, I just want to kind of point a little bit to something that you heard in the opening commentary about PennDOT. I think that's a really important story about what's going on there. Why is PennDOT choosing our solutions? What's going on? Because of the infrastructure bill and some of the money that was put in the infrastructure bill to help some of these departments of transportation understand how to invest in the future, PennDOT looked at its portfolio of tools. They looked at the future. They looked at what they need going out 10, 20 years in the future, what kind of modern stacks they want to work on, and they chose to move to our solutio","The speaker indicates that Innovize will be referred to less frequently as they shift focus to Autodesk's construction and water solutions, emphasizing the growing importance of water management infrastructure due to recent flooding and ongoing water issues.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, maybe for you, Lots to talk about here, right, particularly with the new transaction model. Maybe the right first question here would be, why is this new model, I guess, as consequential as you said in your prepared remarks? Any color there you can add?","Yeah, absolutely. Let me start by saying, you know, first, you know, the business is super resilient. We're built for resilience. And this is really showing up in these results this round as well. And that's going to continue into the future. When we talk about this new transaction model, I think it's important to back up and talk about what we're trying to do with our customers and the journey we've been on. We are trying to do no less than move all of our customers to cloud-based lifecycle solutions powered by AI that connects their design and make processes in a way that they've never had connected before. Now, to do that, you absolutely cannot use 40-year-old systems and business models. So we've been on this relentless journey to modernize the company. We started moving from developing cloud-based products to subscription models to to annualized billings. You've seen journey after journey here to modernize the company. This is the next step and one of the most important steps in modernizing the company so that we have the kind of relationship with our customers that actually matches the kind of technology we're delivering to them. So through this, we're not only going to have direct engagement with our customers through the products they use in the cloud, we're going to have direct engagements with them as a customer, as an account. We're going to understand them at the account level and as an entity, not just as a collection of transactions passed through several tiers. And that's really important because that will not only give us more information about our customers, it will help us give more information to our partners about our customers and understand them significantly better. And it will wrap up the whole solution and business model and capabilities in one package. The other really consequential thing here is our partner network has to move from transaction focused partners to solution focused partners. They are going to be incredibly important on the front lines and helping our customers deploy and integrate new design to make solutions in the cloud. And this is going to be part of that transition for them. So yes, It is very consequential, and it's part and parcel of a long string of modernizations we've been working on for a while, and I do think it's very significant.","Andrew emphasizes the importance of the new transaction model as a crucial step in modernizing the company, moving from outdated systems to cloud-based, AI-powered solutions that enhance customer engagement and partner collaboration.

I'm not going to parse all the details, but I'll just highlight some of the things that we called out in the opening commentary. Those things are the non-recurrence of EBA upfront and true up revenue, FX. And the macro drag on new subscriber growth, these are all things that are headwinds to revenue growth next year. We also talked about the impact, depending on the timing, of this move to a new transaction model. That's going to be a tailwind to revenue.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"So on fiscal 25, following up on Sackett's question, At the analyst meeting earlier this year, Debbie, you showed a chart depicting sustainable double digit growth for Autodesk of 10 to 15% based on a combination of various price and volume components. Are you still adhering to that plethora of price and volume sources of growth or have you changed your thinking in terms of the magnitude or mix of those sources of growth over time?","We are still targeting those sources of growth, Jay, as well as targeting the growth parameters of 10 to 15 points of revenue growth. Really what we're dealing with is this uncertain environment. And based on what we know today and assuming that market conditions are similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters, we do see revenue growth next year of about 9% or more.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2024,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, for you, following up on AU last week, there were a number of quite interesting and useful sessions on your roadmaps and product plans, particularly on AUC, and more broadly with regard to the data model. So let me ask you a an unavoidably complex question about that. So when you, sorry, when you think about the, um, the role of what you call granular data, um, does that ultimately affect as you implement that, um, the packaging or composition or consumption of the software? Um, and you also gave quite detailed description of where you're going with ACC and build and AC generally. but there was no timeline in any of those presentations. So how are you thinking about the GA of much of what you talked about last week at AU in terms of making commercial a very large set of new technologies and features, particularly for AUC?","Yeah, okay. So let me tackle that with the first thing around the granular data. So Ultimately, as you journey down this path, what does happen is the way the product operates, all the products, you know, Forma in particular in terms of how it interacts with Revit and ultimately how those two blend together, they do become an environment that looks very much like the Fusion environment. And that environment is very different, as you know, than what currently exists in most of the mainstream usage of our agency products. So yes, granular data ultimately leads to a different way that people consume and use the products and a different paradigm for which they actually engage with the products every day. So that's clear, okay? Timeline, you know, I don't know exactly which presentation you were in. I suspect given your questions, you were in the more longer term timeline presentation. So a lot of stuff you saw there was over a two to five year timeframe, but A lot of that is going to show up in the two- to three-year timeframe associated with some of the things you heard. Now, I think it's kind of obvious to tell which ones were towards the earlier part of that spectrum rather to the later part of that spectrum. Turning some of these solutions over into infrastructure solutions and combining them with some of our infrastructure stuff probably towards the later end. Getting the data more granular, uniting detailed design and conceptual design and FORMA, probably much more closer. That kind of expectation you can have with those roadmaps.","The question inquires about the impact of granular data on software packaging and the timeline for new technologies discussed at AU, particularly for AUC. The answer explains that granular data will change how products are consumed and used, aligning them more with the Fusion environment, and provides a general timeline indicating that some developments will emerge within two to three years, while others may take longer.",0,4,-0.99999975,0.065573769,7,8,-0.066666662,0.245901635,1,2,-0.333333222,0.028301887,23,9,0.437499986,0.30188679,0,0,0,2,0,0

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"You made some constructive comments about what you're seeing in the AEC business. But more broadly, and as you're well aware, there's quite a bit of ferment going on in that market right now in terms of references to what's come to be called BIN 2.0. As you know, just a couple of months ago at an AEC conference, a customer group launched a new customer-developed design specification for software. You yourselves are working on the dual track of enhancing Revit but focusing on Forma. So a lot's going on in terms of various currents in that industry or part of the industry. Help us understand how you're thinking about managing through all those different dynamics that are going on in the AAC industry.","Yeah, so thanks, Jay. There's three threads to this, all right? One is kind of the core platform thread around data and data flow. At the root of all of this, we need to make sure as much of the data that we have locked inside Revit files and locked in other types of files that our customers have gets turned into APIs wherever possible. This is a lubricant to the workflows that people are worried about, and a big part of really what underpins the whole concept of BIM 2.0. So that's one of the things. The second piece is you've got to make sure that their ability to do detailed, in-depth, complicated, sophisticated BIM models gets more performant, more productive, and faster. That's core to kind of building up and improving Revit in some significant ways, which we're absolutely looking at. But the third point, which I think is more important, is you really need to reimagine how BIM is being done. The paradigm needs to shift, and it needs to shift to the world of not only being cloud-enabled, but also being what we really like to call augmented design-enabled or outcome-based in whatever language we use, so that you can actually change the way people do BIM. And that's one of the big things that we're focusing on with Forma. And that's very different than, you know, we have certain types of competitors. It's in line with what the spec is from the customers. But when you talk about data, Revit improvements, and the move to what we call augmented design or outcome-based design, those are the big thrusts in terms of what we're trying to do to bring the industry to a better way of doing this.","The speaker outlines three key strategies for navigating changes in the AEC industry: enhancing data flow through APIs, improving the performance of complex BIM models in Revit, and shifting towards a cloud-enabled, outcome-based design approach with Forma.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"You made a comment about a new transactional model and a pilot you're going to be undertaking in Australia. So maybe you could elaborate on that. When I hear that, it sounds to me like there's potentially going to be some further change to channel economics. You've just completed the move to back-end only margins. Are you thinking about perhaps taking the flex commission model more broadly across the rest of the business or what exactly you're looking to accomplish with that?","So let me, let's talk about the flex experiment and the things you were doing with flex. First off flex, because it's like a consumption based model and it involves usage of various different products. it's really incredibly helpful for the customer for us to be able to have a much more direct relationship with the customer with regards to that offering. Because that way we're able to offer a lot more visibility to how they're using the offering, what they're using, when they're using it, how much they're consuming, and actually help them get the most out of the offer. So what we've done over the last year is we've proved out a new transaction model, working with our partners and rolling out across various regions that is supporting Flexx. And that is a much more direct transaction model. Through that process, we've learned a lot. We've gained a lot of knowledge. We've addressed a lot of issues, both systems-wise and process-wise. And we are now in a position with Flex to start growing and expanding that model at greater and greater volume. And that's exactly what's happening with Flex. The volume of Flex is increasing, increasing. And we're doing it reliably, repeatedly, and in a pretty positive way.

So maybe just talk a little bit more about how you think about the infrastructure opportunity overall and really what separates Autodesk from competitors in going after it.","Yeah. So look, at a high level, one of the things I'm really excited about the thing with the really long name, the Advanced Digital Construction Management System program that the U.S. government rolled out, that is the program related to the money that's designed to help Department of Transportation look at their infrastructure, look at their processes, and start modernizing their digital processes around design and construction of infrastructure. That's an important step in getting a lot of these Department of Transportation to really start thinking about how they get ready to spend more money on infrastructure and do it better and address the serious capacity challenges we have around materials, manpower, and dollars with regards to what we have to do. So pretty excited about that because that's an open door to having new conversations with these departments about how they do things. Our focus has not changed. We are very much focused on water and road and rail, and we continue to innovate and drive improvements in those areas. I think our biggest differentiator is what we bring to market as a modern architecture. We bring to market more cloud-based solutions, more owner-based solutions for managing the infrastructure once you have it, and really just more technology that's stitched together in different ways.

You know, I think we all try to speak to, you know, at least a subset of your partners through the quarter. And frankly, through the quarter, some of those checks, albeit limited, were mixed or soft, of course, reflecting the macro. Maybe the question that I have for you is, I was wondering if you saw that as well, and if you did, whether some of those trends have maybe continued here through the second quarter.","So, yeah, let me tell you what we saw, and it's consistent with what people heard from the partners. So whenever we have a large event, like ending multi-year, what happens is partners and teams tend to pack up deals into that event. They even pull pipeline forward to try to get it into the event so that they can kind of close their deal, get things trued up around the event. This happens every time consistently when they have an event like this. One of the reasons why we try to align these events with quarter ends so we don't have conversations like this. So if that was the case, what you would have expected is that business would rebound to kind of expected levels post the end of the quarter, which is exactly what happened. It's exactly what we're seeing at the beginning of the quarter. And we're back to what we would expect to be.","The question inquires about mixed or soft performance trends observed through the quarter, asking if these trends continued into the second quarter.

We continue to see cautious optimism from our channel partners. New subscriber growth decelerated a bit quarter over quarter, but renewal rates improved. Also, like last quarter, Europe was a bit better. The U.S. was a bit worse. Asia was about the same. So net-net, the overall momentum of the business was somewhat similar to what we saw last quarter with some puts and takes. It's all in line with the guidance expectations for the year, and it's consistent with macro trends. Current RPO growth is a good forward indicator for you.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Debbie, maybe for my follow-up for you, great to see the cash flow strength this quarter, well ahead of what we were expecting. I was just wondering if you could just zoom into what drove that and maybe just looking forward, how you're sort of thinking about the shape of cash flow this year, particularly where we trough here in fiscal 24. Does that make sense?","Yeah, yeah. So Q1 free cash flow was strong for a couple of reasons. First, cash collections from the last month of billings in fiscal 23 were strong. Second, we also saw favorable linearity and early renewals in Q1 that were driven by the end of multi-year build up front. And then third, as I mentioned on the call, after the winter storms in California, we received a federal tax payment extension for the third quarter. Our overall expectations for free cash flow on the year, including linearity, are unchanged. We still expect that we're going to generate about half of our free cash flow in the second half of the year with heavier weighting to Q4. Some of the factors to think about across Q2, Q3, and Q4, we have the full quarter impact from the switch to annual billings. In Q2, remember that we had some early renewal billings that were pulled into Q1. And then with that tax payment extension to Q3, that has a positive impact of free cash flow in Q1 and Q2, but a negative offset in Q3. But overall, I just would reiterate that our expectations are unchanged and that we expect to generate about half of that free cash flow in the second half of the year.","Debbie highlighted that the strong Q1 free cash flow was driven by robust cash collections, favorable linearity, and a federal tax payment extension.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"Effect on channel behavior in the quarter as a result of the billing change. But more broadly, there are some other evolutions that your sales model is going through affecting not just the VARs, but also the VADs. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about the operational or execution risks associated with that evolution, which certainly goes beyond Q1 in terms of perhaps either demand generation fulfillment of which you'll be doing more of on your own. Perhaps the elements of channel comp as they change with the back-end change. So maybe just let's talk about some of those ongoing executables that you need to get right. These are the sales model, but I'll ask my follow-up.","Yeah, Jay, you know, that's that's a great question So what one of the things that I'll say like first up front is, you know, why why are we exploring some of these things? And it's a great example of of what we're doing with Flex in particular. We're doing these things because our customers get a much more instant-on self-service-like experience, kind of more like an e-store experience from all their transactions, but they also get the added bonus of support that's local and connected to them through their VAR. So they get service and other types of supports from their bars locally. It also allows us to really get a lot of visibility about what their usage patterns are, how they're using the product, and then also share that visibility with our partners and other people so that we can understand these customers better. So there's lots of great things about it, More importantly, rolling out kind of changes like that and exploring these kinds of new models on something like Flex, which is, you know, a lower volume offering right now, though doing quite well, gives us a lot of opportunity to learn a lot of things and work through a lot of things. And, you know, Debbie, why don't you talk specifically about some of the things that we've been learning from Flex as we've been working through all of these new transaction models? Sure. Yeah, so as Andrew mentioned, we launched this Flex agency model in Q1. We have learned a lot. Some of the things that we've been learning are things like the importance of driving a seamless vendor setup process. These are situations where customers will have to set up Autodesk as a vendor as opposed to a partner. We're getting insights and learnings by having access to more data. And we're able to better forecast with having that access to better data. So like Andrew mentioned, as with anything in this area, we're focused on testing and learning as we go. We want to make sure that we have scalable processes for all stakeholders and the ecosystem, and we'll continue to keep doing that.","The question addresses the impact of billing changes on channel behavior and the associated operational risks in the sales model evolution.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q1 2024,Technology and Communications,"As follow-up, Debbie, at the meeting two months ago in your slide with regard to double-digit growth, or what you call sustainable double-digit growth, you had eight different line items referring to volume as components of your growth. When you look at over the balance of the year, what do you think might be of those components perhaps the two or three most important volume drivers to the business?","That's an excellent question, Jay. I mean, the view that I talked about from Investor Day hasn't changed much. Now, granted, our Investor Day wasn't very long ago, so that's a good thing.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Debbie, maybe for you, I was wondering if you'd just give us a little bit more context about how you're thinking about fiscal 24 and beyond from a guidance perspective.","Sure. Hi, Second. How are you doing? So, first, the overall demand environment in Q4 was relatively consistent with what we saw in Q3. If I drill first into the specifics on the guide, for billings, of course, we have the multi-year to annual billings transition. That's creating a headwind, as expected. The transition doesn't have an impact on revenue. It's just a change in billings frequency. On revenue, as we outlined last quarter, we're seeing a negative impact from FX and the Russia exit. Together, that represents five points of headwind to growth. If we normalize for that, the revenue growth range would be in the low teens. On margin, we're managing the flat margins on an as-reported basis year over year. That's consistent with what we said on the last call. We have a strong balance sheet. We have conviction in our strategy, so we want to continue to invest during the cycle so that we can maintain our momentum, but not so much so that we see a detriment to our margin outlook. And I want to point out that our margin guide on a constant currency basis represents improvement year on year. And then finally, on cash flow, the headwind to billings from the transition to annual billings has a downstream effect on cash flow, of course. As I mentioned in the opening commentary, the swing in long-term deferred revenue is having a negative impact of around $1.1 billion to fiscal 24 cash flow. That headwind is driven primarily by that switch to annual billings for multi-year customers. And if we take that with other factors like a lower multi-year renewal cohort and higher cash taxes, we get to that $1.2 billion guidance midpoint. is to set ourselves up for success in fiscal 24 and for the long term. And it's that same sort of thinking that's driving how we're thinking about the longer term financial model. On revenue, our target planning range at 10 to 15%, it remains in that double digit territory. On margin, we're targeting a margin in the 38 to 40% range in the fiscal 23 to 26 window. But we said that because of the macro and FX headwinds that we're seeing, we think it's more likely now that it's going to be in the lower half of that range. And then on cash flow, we'll still work towards double-digit CAGR growth through fiscal 26, but it looks less likely now given the impact of cash taxes, FX volatility, and a stronger-than-expected fiscal 23 finish. As we look ahead, we're focused on managing the business to a rule of 45 ratio or better, which after we get through this multi-year to annual billings transition, we think strikes the right balance between driving top-line growth and delivering on disciplined profit and cash flow.","Debbie provided insights on fiscal 24 and beyond, noting consistent demand, challenges from the transition to annual billings, and negative impacts from foreign exchange and the exit from Russia.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"I guess now that fiscal 24 has finally arrived, if you will, can you just maybe walk through a little bit of detail just on that impact of switching from upfront to annual billings for those multi-year contracts?","Yeah, it has finally arrived. It's nice to finally be having these conversations back. So the transition to annual billings, the rollout, it's happening on schedule. Our systems will be ready. We're assuming that we sell multi-year up front through March 27th. And then at the March 28th go-live, that we only sell multi-year with annual billing terms in mature countries for our platinum and gold partners. That represents a significant majority of the eligible population. There's going to be some remaining multi-year up front in the forecast beyond March 27th. That's going to be coming primarily from e-store and emerging countries, but it's relatively small in comparison to the volume that we saw in fiscal 23. And as we move those populations to annual billings, we'll see a follow-on headwind to free cash flow in fiscal 25. It's consistent with what I said in the opening commentary that the path is not going to be linear. We're assuming that the same proportion of our business that's been multi-year remains multi-year. We think that the price lock that you get in a multi-year contract will entice our customers to continue to buy multi-year, especially in the inflationary environment that we're in. But of course, it's possible that some of our customers choose annual contracts rather than multi-year contracts with annual billing. That wouldn't impact billings or most other financial metrics in fiscal 24, but it would negatively impact the total RPO growth rate. At the end of the day, it's a win-win for us. If our customers choose to go with annual contracts, It gives us an opportunity to engage with them upon renewal to drive adoption and upsell, and our renewal rates are strong. So this is something we'll keep you posted on as the year progresses.","The transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts is on schedule, starting March 28, with most sales in mature countries for platinum and gold partners.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, let me start with you. Your 10Q for the third quarter had some new and intriguing language with regard to how you foresee the evolution of your sales model, specifically your relationship with VARs and VADs, and a lot of complexities in the language there. So perhaps you could talk about how you envision the evolution of your business in terms of the operational or fulfillment or license management effects that you foresee over time or the margin effects over time, and where you think your sales mix ultimately goes over the next number of years in terms of direct versus indirect, then a follow-up.","Okay, great. So I like the way you highlighted this as an evolution. We've been evolving in a particular direction over time. You know, obviously, several years back, I talked about the 50-50 mix of direct and indirect. And we've been driving a lot of growth in direct channels. We've been driving a lot of growth in direct enterprise business. And all of these things kind of like weave together into a longer-term plan. And now what you're seeing us doing is we're driving a lot more direct engagement with some of our value-added resellers. So some of the changes that you saw in there are pre-staging more and more direct engagements with our value-added resellers and smaller engagements and fewer engagements between intermediates and our value-added resellers, which makes total sense between the systems evolutions we've been executing on and the direction we're going. So long-term, we're still driving towards that same type of balance we've been talking about. But as our systems improve, we're looking for different types of engagement models with our value-added reseller channel.","Andrew discusses the evolution of their sales model, emphasizing a shift towards more direct engagement with value-added resellers (VARs) while maintaining a balanced mix of direct and indirect sales.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q4 2023,Technology and Communications,"The slide deck gives us the annual update on your installed base of subscription. The net increase was about $600,000 for the year, net of trade-ins. Looking ahead, how does your long-term growth model foresee the contribution of volume growth, and particularly the effect as well of improving the richness of the mix? perhaps to more collections and so forth, and perhaps by end market. When you think about manufacturing, that volume looks like it's maybe a tenth of your net new volume per year. So you have a lot of volume that has to come from other segments outside of manufacturing. So perhaps you could talk about that.","Sure, I'll take that one, Jay. So let's start at the top. Yes, subscriptions grew in a healthy way. I just want to Remind, however, that there is a lot of variability in that metric, given that we have such a wide diversity of business models in play, things like flex, EBAs, account-based pricing, and so on and so forth. So it does make it less and less of a relevant metric for us to manage business performance. We're more focused on new and renewal ECV. They both posted solid growth in Q4. As we think about New ACV, that's the proxy for, I think, the spirit of your question. We generate it across both volume and also stronger unit economics, things like price mix and partner margins. In general, historically, we've seen it come from roughly equally across those sources and it kind of flexes up or down depending on the demand environment that we're in. We could see some puts and takes like when COVID hit, we saw more growth from volume because volume versus price because we were more sensitive to price increases at the time that the pandemic hit. And then obviously when we're in a situation where we change prices at all, we might see more growth coming from price. All in all, as we think about achieving some of the long-term growth parameters that I talked about, we're thinking about it as a roughly equal split across volume, price, mix, ASP over time.  Andrew, did you want to comment a bit on segments?   Yeah, thanks. J.D., your comment on segments, all right? As you know, and I know you're aware, as we look at the various segments we do business in, we're moving in a situation where we're getting deeply entrenched in both the design and make side of our customer's business.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Debbie, maybe we'll start with you. I don't want to put you on the spot here, but I guess just given the evolving macro and some of the other factors that we spoke about, Is there anything that you want us to know high level on kind of how you're thinking about fiscal 24 as we maybe fine tune our models looking out?","So we'll give formal guidance for fiscal 24 in February when we report on next quarter's results. But here are some things to think about. First on revenue, at this point we expect some exogenous headwinds out of the gate. We'll have about a five-point or so incremental FX headwind. That's because of the continued strengthening of the US dollar. And then another point of incremental headwind from exiting Russia. That's going to make it tough for us to grow revenue beyond double digits. On margin, the revenue headwind creates margin growth headwinds, which likely means limited progress on reported margins in fiscal 24. Put another way, margins will look better at constant exchange rates. And then on free cash flow, facts at consensus right now is a range of 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion. There's a couple of important things to consider. The first is the rate at which our customers transition to annual billings, and the second is the overall macroeconomic environment. We continue to be focused on executing on that transition as fast as possible because While the change is good for us and it's good for our customers, from a financial standpoint, we really want the noise behind us. So remember, the faster that we move the multi-year-based annual billings, the greater the free cash flow headwind we'll see in fiscal 24. On macro, we will, as usual, give our fiscal 24 guidance based on the macro conditions that we see as we exit fiscal 23.","Debbie indicated that formal guidance for fiscal 2024 will be provided in February, but expects challenges such as foreign exchange headwinds and exiting Russia to limit revenue growth and margin improvement.

I was wondering if you'd just go one level deeper, and maybe we could just talk about how demand fared through the quarter. Most of the business, as I think we all know, is pretty high velocity, but I'm curious if you saw changing trends in pipeline or close rates or duration preferences towards the end of the quarter versus earlier? Any commentary there would be helpful.","Yeah, Zach, it's good to hear from you. Look, Q3 was very much like Q2 in that the quarter was fairly consistent, right? What was different between Q3 and Q2 was the slowing down in Europe, you know, taking Russia out. And that was definitely something that was different about the quarters, but that was consistent across the entire quarter. There was no Acceleration or change of that as you proceeded across the quarter. Europe was weak throughout the quarter. As were some of the preferences with regards to multi-year buildings. There was no kind of trend of more and more reluctance as you headed further and further down the quarter. So it was a fairly consistent quarter with regards to all of those things and fairly consistent performance of the business across the quarter. So nothing that fundamentally changed in the quarter. Look, one of the things, another thing that was different about Q3 over Q2 is that, you know, we had some currency fluctuations towards the end. And that really is probably the only thing that was different. And those currency fluctuations were responsible for the majority of the small revenue miss.","The question inquires about changes in demand trends, pipeline, and close rates throughout the quarter.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, for you first, to follow up on some comments you made regarding your strategy at AU and then follow up for Debbie. So at AU, you made some comments with regard to the various clouds that you've introduced. And you made an important distinction between the AEC cloud and the manufacturing cloud, namely that manufacturing cloud is more mature. It's been out in market perhaps longer. So what is your expectation for the maturity or development of the AEC cloud to get it to where you think it needs to be to be comparably mature or capable the way the manufacturing cloud is, the way you described it at AU.","All right, Jay, so I'll start with regards to the format evolution. It's going to be kind of similar to what happened with Fusion, all right? And I'll kind of tell it this way. When we started Fusion, we actually anchored Fusion on two things. We started Fusion upfront the design process. You probably don't remember the early days of Fusion. Fusion was actually a conceptual design application. It was highly focused on consumer product design and upfront design processes. And we started bolting onto it downstream processes close to the shop floor in manufacturing. And we started building cloud-based connections between those two and basically filling out the middle between those two bookends of manufacturing and conceptual design. Think of the evolution of format Very similar to that. The form of cloud is going to start off focusing on the upfront conceptual phases of design, helping architects, planners, developers, all types of people that have to deal with early conceptual decisions about space utilization, aligning and distributing various aspects of development or an individual building, and helping them make some better decisions far up front in the design, but it's also going to work to integrate downstream to what we're doing in construction cloud. So construction cloud will start getting very close to some of the early bits of what Forma does. And over time, what's going to happen is Forma and construction cloud, the construction cloud representing the downstream example of manufacturing, all the bits in between are going to be filled out on the same platform, similar to the evolution that we walked through with Fusion. And that will basically bring the entire process to the cloud over time. But continuously adding value to what our customers are doing today throughout the entire development and evolution of that cloud.","Andrew explains that the AEC cloud will evolve similarly to the Fusion platform, starting with a focus on early design phases and gradually integrating with downstream processes in construction.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then for Debbie, as follow-up, since the door was open to an FY24 discussion, apart from everything else you're doing programmatically, could you talk about some of the things that you're going to be doing with regard to channel compensation in terms of margin structure, comping on annual versus multi-year, and all those various things that you're planning to implement and if those are going to have any effect on your margins and your cash flow?","And Jay, to your second question on channel compensation, the details, they're still in the works, but ultimately... how we think about engaging with our channel partners, engaging with our customers, how we think about the compensation programs, everything is about delivering value to our customers, driving adoption, driving customer satisfaction. So examples of some of the things that you've seen us do historically are things like moving more front-end incentives to back-end incentives that mandate some kind of adoption metric, things like that. Again, all in service of trying to deliver value. And in terms of the impact on margins, well, we haven't guided to margins next year. We haven't guided specifically to anything next year other than some of the breadcrumbs that I just left you guys.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q3 2023,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, a question for you, then a follow-up for Debbie. One of the questions I often get is about the cyclicality of the AEC industry. And as you mentioned, the industry entered this year with a backlog from 2020 and, frankly, even 2019. But as you pointed out, the macroeconomic environment has obviously deteriorated. So my question is, what are you seeing and hearing from this vertical, especially about sort of the go-forward pipeline, as you think about the software that Autodesk sells in the various phases here, design, plan, build, and maintain?","Yeah. So first off, one thing continues to pressure the industry more than the demand, and it is the labor shortages and the capacity to execute. Construction companies still have a backlog of business. They're still struggling to execute through the business that we have. I'm sure you saw that some of the leading indicators of architectural buildings have entered into a shrinking territory, which means that architects are going to see some decline in some of their buildings moving forward, but they also still have a backlog of business. So we're still seeing customers saying, look, you know what? I have a pretty big pipeline of business that I haven't executed on a queue of projects, and I still have capacity problems getting through it. They're labor related, they're material related, they're execution related. So we still have an overhang of backlog that's going to continue into next year for a lot of our customers, and that's what we're hearing from our customers. That's not to say they're not seeing pressure, and that's not to say that they're not seeing some pressure in various segments. But they're still seeing a pretty good book of business for the next 12 to 18 months. Now, as things continue, they'll start to see kind of downward pressure and some of that backlog. But right now, they're all much more concerned about their ability to execute than they are about the book of business that they're accumulating.","The AEC industry is currently facing labor and capacity shortages, impacting execution despite having a backlog of projects from previous years. While there are signs of a potential decline in new architectural projects, companies still report a solid pipeline of work for the next 12 to 18 months, with execution challenges being a primary concern.",0,4,-0.99999975,0.121212118,3,6,-0.333333296,0.272727264,2,5,-0.428571367,0.071428571,15,11,0.153846148,0.26530612,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Andrew, maybe first for you. Maybe we'll start more. I'd love if you could expand a little bit on the comment around moving from products to platforms. You know, that we can all talk about as a platform has evolved, but maybe you can just walk us through what that looks like in the future in terms of a platform from your perspective.","Yeah, I... I want to be careful not to give away all the AU tidbits in some of those discussions. But it's an important question. And second, to put it in perspective, right now we sell literally hundreds of products. And the challenge for our customers is trying to find out which one of these products solves which problems for them. And also the fact that a lot of these products don't talk to each other very easily. So when you're selling hundreds of products, it's really difficult to connect data flows across all those capabilities. It's also really difficult to uniformly deliver multi-platform support, multi-device support, cloud computing, and AI automation. It's just really challenging. So what we're doing is we're moving away from this kind of disconnected portfolio of products to really a set of platforms that target each one of our industries with some underlying core technologies that support all of them. That will enable us to actually deploy capabilities to our customers as they need them for particular types of problems. For instance, advanced manufacturing capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis, simulation capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis. So they get access to what they need, when they need it, and it's all unified from a data flow point of view. This is kind of going to be revolutionary for a lot of our customers in terms of the evolution and where we're taking them. So it's really valuable. for our customers in terms of connecting how they work and the value they get from each one of our products. And it's really important to us in terms of delivering more layers of automation and power to them through the cloud. So it is a journey. It's not going to happen overnight. But Fusion is an excellent example of where we're going and how we could deploy some of these things to our customers, especially when you look at the way extensions work, consumption works on top of the Fusion platform. It's a good model for where we're taking industry platforms for each one of our industries.","Andrew discusses the transition from a wide range of disconnected products to unified platforms tailored for specific industries, which will enhance data flow, automation, and customer support.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Can you just talk a little bit about the multi-year? You know, how are those renewals? You know, I know they're starting to trickle in from three years ago in a bigger way. How are those renewals kind of coming in versus your expectations? And maybe looking forward, how do you plan on phasing that option out?","Sure, so we continue to track the multi-year cohort closely. Our proportional volume for multi-years has been in line with our expectations for the first half of fiscal 23, so that gives us confidence in our fiscal 23 outlook. We also saw long-term deferred revenue as a percent of total deferred revenue tick up. That, too, was in line with our expectations. As we look ahead to the transition from upfront to annual billing, well, it hasn't started yet. We anticipate that the transition is going to start in early fiscal 24, and we continue to work through the programmatic and operational details to get there. Things like the partner transition plans, back office system upgrades, but I'll say again, it's our bias to go as quickly as possible.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Firstly, what are you hearing from design customers in this segment about what continues to drive their incremental spending on Autodesk despite the cloudier macro? And then secondly, the 45% quarter-to-quarter growth in Autodesk Build, MAUs, and the slide deck, and your commentary on just the building connected volumes also really stood out to us. Similarly, what are you hearing from these construction customers about why they also continue to lean in on digitizing their workloads in spite of the macro? Or is this becoming because of the macro volatility that they're digitizing?","Okay. That was a multi-part question. I will address it. So first off, let's talk about what we're hearing from design customers. The number one thing we're hearing from the design segment is the backlog of business. They have more business right now than they're able to effectively execute on. And the requirements of that business are increasing in terms of what kind of tools they need to use, how they need to approach the problems. Owners, municipalities, all sorts of customers that they deal with are putting more requirements on how they have to work. So they're all looking to kind of up their game in digital tools. The biggest challenge we hear from these customers is hiring, frankly. You know, we were hearing last year a lot of conversations about, oh, boy, you know, fixed-bid contracts and inflationary pressures and all these things. As I've said previously, they bake these things now into their business bids, and they're able to capture those costs in their contracts. But what they're struggling with is hiring, yet we're still growing even as they struggle to hire because they're getting people in, but they have – more demand for manpower and person power than they actually are able to capture at this point. So that's something we're hearing really robustly. Now let's go to the growth in construction. First off, I want to give you my quarterly disclaimer. When you look at the construction business, the bank number does not capture the full story on the construction business. The EBA growth is hidden in the design bucket. So when you count how we're doing with our enterprise business agreements and the overall territory business We grew close to 30% in that business. So that's really quite nice growth. And what we're hearing, and I'm glad you picked up on the 45% growth in monthly active users, we're hearing a couple of things. One, first off, we've lit up our territory business, our partners in the territory. And this is driving a lot of really nice growth in the US and in Europe. And it's gonna continue to drive that growth. And that's bringing up closer to certain customers lower down in the market, the mid-market and below, which I think is a really important point in our journey. The other thing I want to talk about is when customers are starting to realize is they need a lot more than just a project management or a construction site management tool. They really are looking to their future where they're trying to connect the design and the build all the way together continuously. And one of the big linchpins in all of that is pre-construction planning. The vast majority of the cost and complexity of a construction project is built in during the pre-construction planning phase. You get that wrong, you bid wrong, you come in with lower margins, you have more turn and complexity in your project. So this connection between design, pre-construction, all the way to build is increasingly really important to their customers. So customers are taking a lot more time to evaluate what they're trying to invest in. And I think you also probably noticed at least a little bit in the introductory commentary that infrastructure is a big play for us here. So Department of Transportation, and you saw Indiana, the Indiana Department of Transportation lead into our portfolio for looking at their future needs. We're hearing more and more from Departments of Transportation that are really looking to upgrade and modify their stack to be much more designed to build on a much more modern cloud infrastructure. So there's a lot going on in construction, Phil, and it's coming at us from multiple directions, and right now it's all positive.","Design customers are increasing their spending on Autodesk due to a backlog of business and rising demands for advanced tools, despite challenges in hiring.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"You have, by our calculation, the largest R&D budget in your peer group, but you don't necessarily have the largest headcount in R&D.

Yes, you are correct. We have the largest R&D budgets, but we don't necessarily have the largest headcounts on R&D. Part of that is because of where we concentrate on R&D and what kind of talent we're pursuing. We're pursuing a lot of cloud talent, a lot of cloud native talent, full staff development talent that allows us to build out the core cloud capabilities and continue to expand them.

We don't hire a lot of R&D content headcount that's associated specifically with customer-specific development in, say, other parts of the world.

"Autodesk, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"Now, Construction Cloud delivered its best new business growth quarter ever. You signed your second largest EVA ever with an infrastructure company, and I loved, obviously, the example of a manufacturing vendor getting current, moving to subscription from a lapsed perpetual license. But when you think about this, investors have been concerned about Autodesk exposure specifically to these cyclical end markets and the potential impact to your business. However, the numbers you just reported, the large deals you highlighted clearly don't show this. So my questions are, what are you hearing from customers about why Autodesk is seeing sustained demand and what gives you confidence in the durability of these drivers?","Yeah. So, Phil, I think somebody wrote a report about us not being a cyclical business anymore. I can't remember who it was. A variant of two analysts, probably, yes. Probably an incredibly bright analyst. So, look, you know, a couple of things happened in the quarter, and, you know, we're projecting those forward through the year just consistently. And I think it's important to kind of just talk about this notion of diversification, not only of geographical spread of our business, but discipline spread and also business model spread. And I'll talk about that on a couple of vectors. So first off, let's just talk about what kind of highlighted in resiliency around our business. Throughout the quarter, the monthly active usage that we track regularly continued to strengthen throughout the entire quarter. It continued to strengthen right up to the end. Yes, we absolutely saw a pullback during the early part of the invasion of Ukraine in Europe. But that rebounded as the quarter progressed. So one, we have a strong demand environment, and we're selling into that demand environment from multiple vectors, construction, infrastructure, and general building design, as well as manufacturing. So we're working across these things. And what was happening at the same time, and I think this is an important point about the underlying kind of health and resilience in our business, is even when we saw dips in our new business growth in Europe during, you know, just as the invasion in the Ukraine started, which, by the way, recovered as the court progressed, renewal rates strengthened broadly. So we saw broad strengthening in renewal rates. So that broad strengthening in renewal rates actually was able to offset some of the slowness in the new businesses. All of these things are things that we expect to see continue throughout the year. and provide durability and stability for our business. Now, the U.S. was strong during the year as well. We did see some softness early on in APAC because it was most sensitive to the currency effect. But if you take out some of the COVID-effective regions like Japan and China, or just Japan specifically, we saw much higher growth rates in APAC than are indicated by the overall results. All of this is a balance between new business, and offsetting impacts from renewal businesses. So between the diversity of our geographic diversity, where we're kind of distributed across multiple spaces, the vectors of diversity we have around selling into infrastructure, construction, core design, manufacturing, and the offsetting of really strong renewal rates, increasing renewal rates, even in areas of weaker or at least some weakness in new business, that gives us confidence in terms of the durability for the rest of the year.","Autodesk's recent strong business growth, including significant deals and increased renewal rates, indicates sustained demand despite investor concerns about cyclical markets.

Five or six years ago when you went through your first multi-phase transition in the model, you were very conscientious about making sure you got the channel through all the changes in terms of upfront upgrades, maintenance, and so forth. And so when you look into next year and beyond, How are you thinking about preserving or managing channel margins, their cash flow, their recurring revenue streams as you go through that valley of your own cash flow next year and then look to a rebound in fiscal 25? That's the first question.","Yeah, all right. Okay, so let's start with that, Jay. So first off, let's just back up and talk about the high-level principle that we're working towards here, right? We're trying to move away from these upfront multi-year deals to annualized billings. None of us want this. We don't like the way it creates a lumpiness in our cash flow. Frankly, our partners don't like the way it creates a lumpiness in their cash flow as well. And they don't like discounting to get multi-year upfront deals closed. So you look at this, we're trying to create a more stable, reliable, and predictable cash flow build out. beyond FY24 and beyond. So yes, FY24 will be the trough. But after that, we're going to grow much more consistently, double digits out and predictably moving forward, which is what we want, what you want. We can't get there fast enough. And frankly, our partners can't get there fast enough. So we do integrate programs to help them get there. One of the core programs here right now is we're encouraging them to work with us on conserving some of that upfront cash they are going to be collecting. Because, you know, that's cash flow directly into the partner's pockets, all right? And then we do adjust for early on some of their back-end incentives to ensure that they can transition smoothly from a cash flow basis and continue to work and support our business the way they have. So it's not that different from what we've done previously. But you're right, we have to support them through this dip. But once we're all through this dip, it's this nice predictable cash flow buildup that we all want, and it's going to create a stronger and more reliable business and more durable business.

Could you speak about that, Andrew, in terms of vertical or end markets? You spoke about it by geo and generally, but could you speak about it in terms of AEC, including in particular ACC, manufacturing, and perhaps even what are you seeing in terms of standalone apps versus collection usage?","yeah um here's what's interesting all right and this is another one of these things that's just you know really great about our portfolio is the the increase in monthly active usage was broad-based there wasn't any particular place that was uh stronger or weaker than the other all right so we saw increases in monthly active usage of autocad revit uh inventor fusion uh um And, you know, in fact, in construction cloud, we saw a 30% year-over-year increase in monthly active usage, which is, you know, a really nice surge on the construction cloud side.

But they, so the confidence that we have is typically, number one, based off of what we have in backlog and is tangible.

We still have a customer, I'm not saying that there aren't other smaller ones, but a customer in Europe that has an inventory hangover that we think will last through probably the first part of the first quarter, but I think our expectations are that, and we're already seeing from that customer, they don't have everything of everything.

And then we have new carriers that we have won that are not yet, one of them just now getting into the lab with, that's a multinational carrier. We expect that the first country there to be deployed will probably be in Spain. And that will happen later on in the year. So it's really a mix. And then you have, to really complicate things, you have B coming in, which is also a mix. We have carriers that our current plans are that they're going to be deploying and accessing B funds.

Europe on fiber to the prims. and from an subscriber, you know, the RGs, ONTs is actually fairly solid. We did have the shift, but that's not indicative of anything other than, you know, they bought and then they don't buy and then they buy. So I would say that that market is actually doing fairly well. And on subscribers, it was actually up. I mean, it's, so if they didn't buy infrastructure, then they bought something to connect up customers, right? So that was actually very good to see. Optical is where, the biggest concern is in Europe. And we really didn't see a whole lot of change there. You know, I fully expect subscribers and access to have a good quarter in Q3. I think the question mark that we have is, you know, optical, and right now expectations are for it to be kind of flattish, but, you know, that's where the biggest concern is. And then, all right, so you also asked about SDX, and SDX is relatively new. We just kind of launched that. We launched a big suite of software for both optical and for the SDX a little earlier this year. That's just now getting out there. I think I wouldn't call it conversions for some customers. If you're a greenfield customer, you typically go with SDX. Or if you're, you know, you heard certain metrics, so people still buy the 5,000 and they buy the SDX. So I wouldn't call it a conversion. I would say it's either or. It's just this quarter we just seem like everybody that bought the system this quarter that was new was an SDX customer.","The outlook for Europe is positive, particularly in fiber to the premises, with subscriber numbers increasing despite fluctuations in infrastructure purchases.

The optical space, we have one large customer in Europe and we have one large customer in the U.S. that are actually hurting our optical business.

I know that your CP business kind of went through that excess inventory and digestion phase. I think we're out of it now, but I'd love to hear your comments there.

What parts of the business are still going through it? You know, what's the picture?","Yeah, sure. So let me start with where I think the least amount of inventory is. And that's in our access and aggregation and predominantly our, you know, fiber to the prem OLT product line. So there's just not a lot out there at this point in time. So that one has been the least impacted. And I think, you know, you can kind of see that in the numbers and the growth that we saw in fiber to the prem. Middle of the road would be subscriber. I think there are many customers that no longer have inventory situations, but there are some that still do. I mean, we kind of did, I talked to some customers this last week, and there are some that still have a buildup of inventory because they just got too many in. But I would say it's a mixed bag with more, and every month that gets better. And then optical, I think you're correct. I think that's probably the least one where we're through that inventory situation. If there are some larger customers that just have some, those impact the numbers kind of disproportionately. But that itself is getting better, but it's got the longest path ahead of it. Does that answer your question?","The speaker discusses the current state of excess customer inventories across different business segments, noting that the access and aggregation segment has the least inventory issues, while the optical segment still faces challenges but is gradually improving.

I guess I... want to delineate between what is a byproduct of excess inventory versus what is just genuinely softer consumption rates by customers. Do you have a perspective on that?","It depends. There are so many different ways to dissect that. Europe, especially with larger customers on the access side, they're just moving ahead with their plans. So, you know, one of the reasons we had a strong European quarter. In the U.S., I'd say there's some caution, but it's spotty. And you talk to customers, I'm sure, as well.

If you look at, so first of all, subscribers had a pretty strong quarter last quarter, especially if I look at the residential piece of subscribers.

"ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then can you characterize for us just in the CPE, you know, subscriber and solutions, you know, I mean, how far are we towards this inventory correction being done? You know, so a quarter later, Sort of where are we with inventory and CPE?","Not great visibility there, so tough to put a real number on it. It feels like we're just kind of bouncing around the bottom. I mean, it feels like there's still a lot of inventory in the field, but there are specific projects that we're winning. And actually, there's some incremental market share that we are picking up and we'll start shipping in the fourth quarter. That's kind of still offsetting what the original flow was. So I would say we're kind of just flattish. And I don't expect a real change in that through this year. So I would expect that to carry forward all the way through the end of this year. Really any growth you see in that and to some extent even offset of slowness is being offset by just new wins.","The inventory correction in CPE is progressing slowly, with a lot of inventory still in the field and only modest market share gains expected.

"ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"And then I guess just any color you can help us in sort of understanding how you know, on the optical piece, on the Adva piece, that this sort of, you know, inventory correction sort of hits all at once. So, you know, just any color on, I mean, it's such a big magnitude, just more color there. And, you know, is this across, U.S., Europe, enterprise, service provider. It seems like the whole business is being affected. So I just love some more color there. And then my real final last question, which I'll leave you with here and pass it on, is any early thoughts on 24? Do you think that there should be a strong growth here in 24 or that these issues will kind of make the visibility of 24 hard to say? Thank you.","That last question is a really good question. First on the timing, that's not dissimilar to what we saw on the ad trend, if you remember. The impact on the subscriber piece came very quickly. If I look back and if I look at the aggregation, the aggregation product line went through a very similar process. phenomena, the difference was the magnitude of the new customer wins offset the declines, you know, let's say to some extent offset and to a large extent offset the declines that we were seeing because of inventory corrections from existing customers. So I think the phenomena was similar. So on the optical piece, we're adding customers, right? I mean, I have no doubt. If I take a look at the the new customer wins over the last six months, it's probably the biggest, and I'm looking at Uli here, but it's probably the biggest we've ever seen in such a short period of time. We're adding new customers. As you know, those customers take a long time to turn on. And so it just doesn't have, and it doesn't have the same runway that we did on the Access and Ag, which kind of grew market size-wise at a different pace earlier. So I don't think there's a change in kind of the way that the impact is being felt. So I think that answered that. And then as far as next year, so yeah, for next year, look, I mean, you know, I mentioned that, you know, the majority of the customers that we have out there are either very slowly online or just coming online, and that's just on the access piece. They're still... significant number of opportunities that are out there that haven't been awarded yet. We're picking up over 26 customers or something like that this quarter. So sooner or later, that eclipses the slowness in the existing base. And I think that the slowness in the existing base on the access, I would expect that to recover the quickest. So on ag, we should have a fantastic year next year. Subscriber, you know, I'm worried about the magnitude of the inventory and kind of, because that inventory is not just AdTrend inventory. That inventory is everybody's inventory because, you know, customers do swap RGs and ONTs routinely. So that one's just more difficult to guess. I'm willing to say expect it through this year. It's very difficult to call an end to it. You know, I'm going to, you know, I don't think it lasts into the second half of next year. Could be still some hangover in the first half. In aggregate, though, that's a relatively, you know, if we're at the bottom, which we believe, then it'll just be kind of hanging out there. And then on the optical piece, look, it could actually, you know, I could see that. I could see the bottom. The bottom I would expect in the second half when we actually see a rebound. I would expect it. Here again, I don't expect it to be as long as the second half of next year. So if you look at that in aggregate, you've got two pieces of business that come online at latest in the second half and kind of a different trajectory than the bottom that we're starting to feel right now. And then you've got Access and Ag that's going gangbusters. So I expect next year to be a solid growth year in aggregate.","The question inquires about the widespread impact of inventory corrections across various markets and seeks insights on growth expectations for 2024.

"ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Technology and Communications,"Tom, you referenced several times the Huawei replacement situation that's playing out both in Europe and I guess to some extent here in the U.S. Can you give us some sort of color on what inning we're in and In that process, I mean, how much of a tail do we have left for that? Thanks.","Sure, I'll give you some. So basically, if you're in Europe, maybe we should do a heat map on kind of where Huawei is still in, because I think we could do that with just public data, which would give you a better feel for it. But the way to think about it, if you're in Western Europe, and you're still using Huawei, then you're still yet to be, then you still have work to do. And my sense is we're probably in process right now, so that's either awarded RFP or contract. My sense is we're probably, I mean, it's got to be less than 30%. So because in each of these countries, you have multiple carriers. And Usually in those cases, you've got one carrier that's made a move, you know, potentially, but not the entire carrier base within that customer. And I would say that's kind of the way I would see access. And then you have the optical piece, which is later. It has just absolutely started later. And some of that may be inherent capacity that they had into their network. But we really saw a big movement in, let's say, activity and awards six months ago. And where we saw that a year, at least a year ago on the access fee. So I would say they're not as far into that.

"ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"So in terms of the business of infrastructure, broadband infrastructure and optical, I mean, the results came in good. So I'm just trying to understand your forward-looking commentary in those businesses. I know... think ADVA this morning guided to high single-digit revenue to low double-digit revenue growth for 2023. So could you talk, I guess, give us color on that, but on the broadband infrastructure portion, you know, what you're seeing there, you know, in the U.S. and in Europe, and maybe expand on some of those comments you made earlier about the macro and about specific carriers, please.","Yeah, sure. So you're right. As far as infrastructure business had a good quarter. The trepidation that we have is the fact that it's not very clear where inventory pockets are. So I think there's two things going on that are kind of creating that nervousness. One is people are bringing their inventory levels down. So they have been buying inventory or trying to effectively stockpile inventory during the supply chain crisis. And in certain areas, they stockpiled more inventory than others. So on CPE, if you think about how a network is built, the one thing you don't want, and I've talked myself to tens of different carriers, and as a company, we've talked probably to 50 or 60 different customers In general, one thing that rang through was you did not want to not have CPE gear because that was the area that you actually start generating revenue at. So you can always forego other things, but that's one piece you don't want to forego. So that inventory buildup was various levels of different carriers, but in general, everybody was building inventory. So I think that was the one that was the most exacerbated. I think the thing that we're also being cautious of, though, is that although there may not be large inventory builds in other areas of the business, people are going to readjust to the current lead times, which are down materially from where they were six months ago. So lead times used to be 52 weeks. They're probably closer to three to, excuse me, maybe four months-ish or something like that. So not only do you have more inventory on your shelves, but your ordering will also now reflect that lower lead time. So trying to figure out how much inventory in the field, how much do they have to burn through, and then adjusting for that impact as they actually wean that inventory off just gets us to a position where we just need to be cautious going through this and plan with that cautious mindset. And if it burns off quicker, we're fine, right? I mean, no problem, but we just need to make sure that we actually manage the company for an environment that is a little bit right now murky because of that inventory situation. Underlying demand, really nothing has lightened up. I would say, in fact, we were talking here over the last week or so about the activity going on. In Europe right now, in both fiber access and in optical transport, and it just has not slowed down. In fact, it's probably, I think I mentioned on my notes that in optical transport, it's as high as we've seen in a very, very long time, maybe in 10 years or more. So really when there was the last big upgrade cycle. So activity hasn't slowed down, and none of the plans of the major carriers have slowed down. So I mentioned in my note how there's been some acceleration in some of them. most specifically in Europe. So that hasn't changed a bit. The U.S., there are a couple of pockets where, you know, you have people that are slowing down. Tier 3s still had a good quarter. They still seem to be going well. In the U.S., it's more about inventory adjustment as well. I would say they're similar, although I would say, you know, the thing going on in Europe seems to have been less impacted than what we saw in the U.S. I don't know if I answered your question or not, Michael. I hope so.","The infrastructure business had a strong quarter, but there are concerns about inventory levels as companies adjust their stockpiles following the supply chain crisis.

"ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2023,Technology and Communications,"On the piece of inventory that you, you know, really came to your attention this quarter on the CPE in the channel, or at the customers as well, you know, I think there was some commentary on the call that you really don't expect that to get very much worse.

I mean, could you just give us a sense for where lead times are on those products right now? Where were they, say, in the summer of last year? And then do you think there's some possibility of access inventory build in those areas of the business as well?","Yeah, I think there is some possibility. So let me start with lead time. So lead time, those tended to have the most difficult chip situations because they tend to be very complex chips that are using those typically higher price chips. And then in some cases where you're buying optical subassemblies, you know, those lead times also extended out as well. And in general, you can say 52 weeks. And so the thing that's kind of a little bit harder to figure out is, okay, at 52 weeks, you know, does this cycle last at over 52 weeks? So we were forecasting out 52 weeks.

Yeah, so 52 weeks plus, I guess, as you could say. But we were forecasting out 52 weeks and we were placing orders in some cases for 52 weeks ahead. So, you know, you would think that would start getting better. And that's really kind of the benefit that we're seeing right now in some of these complex chips that is getting better and those lead times are coming down. One, because of orders that we place and two, because lead times in general are diminishing.

You know, it's a little weird to talk about who it is or who it isn't, but I've actually just, and this might get me in trouble someday, but, you know, it's not NVIDIA. I've been trying to be pretty clear with people because it's just not fair. I guess at some point, If NVIDIA ever goes with us now, what am I going to say? But they are a revenue-generating company today. They have customers. They're doing very well. It's pretty exciting. There's some discussion about being able to go public with them once we have successfully demonstrated it. They really would have a huge benefit by moving their system level test burn-in to wafer level. And I can't decide who's more excited about this, if it's us or them, with them cheering us on to please hopefully make this work for them. This is an interesting one because we are doing some pretty unique things. that I'll just share a little bit about, but I'm also holding things to my chest because of competitive reasons. I just don't want to give away any of our secrets. But, you know, the idea to actually be putting, you know, I mentioned, you know, 2,000, 3,000 watts on a wafer, 3,500 watts on a wafer. If you're actually close to this technically, you would know that all AI processors are at these geometries and lithographies are all one volt or thereabout parts. What that means, if you're going to do 3,000 watts, you're putting 3,000 amps onto a wafer. People's heads spin with the idea of putting 1,000 amps, much less 2 or more thousand amps on a wafer. And so what we're doing is quite novel. And we're using the Fox XP system that we shipped first to optical AI. At the last quarter, we mentioned that, that we were working on something else on the side, stay tuned, but that's what we were alluding to. The development of that system in terms of the power, being able to put that much power out and remove that much power, because you have to remove it all through the wafer itself, is totally novel. How we deliver that power for optical IO is actually, interestingly, a little higher voltage and lower current, Whereas in the AI, it's higher current and lower voltage. But the thermal challenge is the same. So we have a lot of confidence through that. We're working through that with this right now. And I walked in back just now and was talking to the ops guys.

Aehr Test Systems,Q2 2024,Technology and Communications,"You talked about, you know, we're seeing a slowdown, you know, given all the reasons that you mentioned, but then you went on to say, you know, that that does not change your growth expectations for years ahead. Can you let us know what are your growth expectations? What do you think, you know, the top line growth rate of the company on a multi-year basis will be?","Yeah, we probably set ourselves up for that, Christian, because as you know, we haven't given a multi-year growth strategy on here. Let me answer it this way instead, and I know that we'll be giving next year's guidance in July. I'm not yet sure we'll commit to a multi-year or not, but when we talk to the customers, one of the hardest things about preparing for this for this call was not even 30 days ago, we were still hearing across the board from our customers bookings and shipment slot requests that were consistent with us succeeding $100 million. It's only been in the last couple few weeks that we've seen things, including all the way in that last weekend, where they've sort of finalized what their plans are and pushed some things out. These customers have not changed their long-term plans, their forecasts for their revenue growth, their market share, their silicon carbide, their test times, you know, those kind of things. We think are still consistent with what we had been asked, which includes, by the way, test time reductions over time, consistent with the models that we generated, you know, a couple few years ago. where if you look at a 4 million wafer starts or thereabouts to support just the EV market, it would take somewhere on the order of 2,000 wafers of capacity or 2,000 of our blades for the overall market. And so we haven't changed that. In fact, I'll add one more thing here. Those numbers were based on this 30% penetration of 100 million vehicles or 30 million EVs in 2030. I keep using that 30, 30, 30 number. Last year for the bulk of the year, there were many people saying that EVs were going to be faster than that. There will be more than 30% penetration. We actually never repeated that because our feeling was that just seems too aggressive. So in some ways, people's growth estimates have kind of modulated back to be consistent, I think, with those 30, 30, 30 numbers. So in that sense, it hasn't changed our opinion. But if you, you know, you start looking at a discrete customer who was, you know, going to put in enough, you know, start installing tools this spring for having them ready in the fall, and, you know, they shift things out two or three or four months, all of a sudden it impacts us. And that, you know, that's the downside of the front end of this. And What I hope people hear today and throughout the whole Q&A is we're trying to be as absolutely candid as possible. And what the customers were telling us in previous quarters, we were communicating, and now they have changed their timing of it, and we're just trying to communicate that to it. We still have the capacity and the capability to exceed $100 million this year. If the customers came in and said, just kidding, I need them after all, we still have the ability to do that. but right now that's just doesn't seem like the most likely case. We don't think that is impacting our plans going forward and that we think we still have these, you know, pretty solid growth expectations for next year and beyond.","The speaker acknowledges a recent slowdown but maintains that long-term growth expectations remain unchanged, citing consistent customer plans and market forecasts.

They are fully RIP, but we have contracted to have them completely built externally. to our facility here, and I wouldn't call them pass-through because it's not that, but they tend to be on the lower end of the margin.

It's actually interesting. There's a combination of capacity and sort of our current reality. And I mean that in terms of just, you know, right now, what are we doing and what are we, you know, right now we're probably shipping somewhere in the 50 blades or wafers of capacity a month. So think of a Fox XP with 18 blades in it, two and a little of those or something. That's about what we're currently doing. We have more capacity than that, but that's actually our build plan that's equal to or a little bit higher than what our current customer requests and demands are. We have the material and pipeline to be able to ship upwards of maybe five systems or 100 wafers of capacity a month by this summer and could actually ship another, perhaps even 2x that or 10 systems a month in a year. That is not what we're currently believing our forecast is, candidly, but it's feasible to be that. And so it's an interesting scenario. We're actually using our capacity and our short lead times and our supply chain as one of our believed to be competitive advantages. We have companies in our space that have 52-week lead times. That's not air test. So we've deliberately taken the position that we are putting capacity and infrastructure and material in place to be able to go say yes to as many customers as we possibly can. And that's why we have this capacity available to us. Now, one more thing we have said in the past, we did extend our lease here and finalize that just over the last month or so. We've got plans that were on the works right now to do some facility upgrades and all. That's actually going to help us with some infrastructure in terms of electrical and water to be able to do more in parallel.

We had said before there are automated handlers that are in about 800K range type of thing, whereas the manual liners are significantly cheaper than that. So if you use that kind of number, that's probably fair. And again, you could buy one that could feed five XP chambers. If you had 10 chambers on the floor, you might need two of them. And you use wafer packs and wafer pack carts moving around. And there's some companies that prefer that model. That's similar to how Package Part Burnin' has operated for years.

You know, and can it ramp, you know, to the level that your largest customer ramped once they started making, you know, production type of orders on a kind of a...","I mean, a couple of questions in there. I mean, the traditional model is people usually take like one system and they will sit on it and work through some issues or just make sure it gets called into production. Then they'll order another one, and you go through lead times and then start shipping it. I would say that's not what the shape looks like with these customers. It's more of full systems, maybe multiple systems in a short period of time, and in some cases in multiple facilities, and it's kind of go, go, go. So now the other customer has, you know, our lead customer has been making some really significant investments. They, to some extent, led the industry in this wafer level burn-in push, and it's certainly being felt in the industry. Everybody's quite aware of it. And, you know, they took a pretty long time to absorb the first one and then started ramping pretty hard. My guess is that it's, you know, softer during the first six or 12 months, and then it gets stronger thereafter. We'll see. It depends on the customer. It's kind of interesting. I mean, even with test times, I've been engaged with customers, and they'll tell me their test time is such and such over and over and over again. And then they go to place the order, and then they tell me their real test times, and they're longer than they were. Why is that? Is it just they're trying to be coy or not tell you everything? So right now when things happen, we're definitely trying to ferret out long lead and forecast for multiple customers. as we just stated, to just make sure we have plenty of material on, you know, that is being purchased.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,I just want to get a better sense of whether there were any specific strategies that drove the positive net flows that you saw in the quarter there.,"Hi, Ken. It's nice to speak to you again. Yeah, I think what was really exciting about Q4 sales and sales for 2024 was actually the breadth of strategies that we saw clients funding. You know, we've seen clear growth in both enhanced equities and our extension strategies recently, but, you know, also saw substantial assets moving into a number of our sort of more traditional core strategies as well, where we are gaining market share in a number of areas. So it was pretty broad in Q4, but with those themes of enhanced and extensions being sort of two of the more prevalent.","The positive net flows in Q4 were driven by a diverse range of strategies, particularly in enhanced equities and extension strategies, alongside growth in traditional core strategies where market share is being gained.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"And just on that, and thanks again for the additional details around some of the newer systematic strategies, the enhanced equity, the systematic credit, the equity alternatives. I wonder if you could just help us frame out the longer-term AUM opportunity specifically for Acadian for these kind of strategies. How much growth could you see AUM grow over time there? And then somewhat relatedly, what's sort of like the fee rate opportunity here? Is the typical fee rate a little bit higher or lower than the average fee rate that you're seeing currently for Acadia?","Sure. Yeah. We're very pleased, I think, with the progress that we've made in both of those initiatives. And we're in a strong position and don't anticipate any sort of additional investments really needed for those. We're obviously still in the period of incubating both of those track records or building longer term tracks there. But I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a very, very large credit market. Systematic credit is certainly something more newer and more nascent. But we think the opportunities there really could be substantial over time, sort of large mandates that we would expect to see there as we continue to incubate those track records. On the equity alternatives platform, again, you know, multi-strategy has been a very popular area, I think, over the last few years in the market. And as we continue to build, I think, a strong and compelling offering there, again, we think there's sort of substantial upside in terms of AUM growth. So, you know, hard to put those numbers on those. But again, I think we feel very positive about the opportunities in both of those. With respect to fees, again, Certainly on the credit side, you would expect to see fees, I think, in terms of the blended fee that we see for average fees across the business, perhaps a little lower there. But again, I think that's certainly going to depend on the dynamics and where we see flows coming into across the credit business. Equity alternatives. And with the hedge fund platform, again, you would expect to see much higher average fees there versus what we see in our more traditional core strategies. So I think we feel very positive about both AUM potential growth there as well as excited about the impact on revenue and certainly for the equity alternatives platform.","The respondent expresses optimism about Acadian's long-term AUM growth potential in systematic credit and equity alternatives, highlighting substantial opportunities as they build their track records.

Given the cash on balance sheet, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about potential cash needs for this coming year, and I think you have an upcoming note maturity as well. Any plans around that?","Sure. As you know, the balance sheet is very strong, and the business generates very good free cash flow. It gives us financial flexibility to whether it's to fund those organic growth strategies, returning capital to shareholders and paying down debt. So we haven't got pre-allocations in mind. As you noted, the senior note matures next year. We'll start looking into refinancing options for that note and want to be prudent in terms of maintaining good leverage ratios and financial flexibility there, obviously focusing on what makes most sense for shareholder value.","The question inquires about the company's cash needs and plans for an upcoming note maturity.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,Just wondering if you could maybe provide some color on composition and the magnitude of the pipeline. Maybe frame that how frame that versus how it was like three to six months ago.,"Sure, thanks, Emily. Yeah, we have a very strong, robust pipeline. I'd say across a number of different strategies and a very strong one not funded pipeline that we expect to see those those clients fund over the next, I'd say, one to two quarters. We've seen the pipeline tick up quite significantly, I'd say, through the second half of 2024 going into 2025. And again, I think the themes you're going to see are going to be consistent with my prepared remarks earlier that enhanced and extensions are two areas where we continue to see areas of focus for clients. But again, our traditional core equity strategies, and certainly in some of our more niche areas like small cap, are proving very popular and gaining a lot of attention. So I'd say the pipeline looks incredibly robust, perhaps more robust even than six months ago when we felt very positive going into the second half of last year. And as I say, across the breadth of strategies, which from our point of view, from the diversification point of view, is really nice to see.","The pipeline is currently very strong and has significantly improved compared to three to six months ago, with increased client interest in various strategies, particularly in enhanced extensions and core equity.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,Do you think there's any potential opportunities for any further expense reductions going forward as the structure gets streamlined?,"Yeah, as we've always said, we maintain expense discipline, and we continue to find opportunities, and we continue to be really laser focused on being as efficient as we can be. So going forward, you know, we'll continue the same approach, but it's hard to say at this point whether there are any obvious opportunities. As we've talked about last two years, we've actually been investing in the infrastructure. We've upgraded our investor reporting capabilities. We've invested in our trading capabilities. And so what that will do is that it makes our platform much more scalable, and we also face the inflation pressures that we've touched on. So what I would say is that at this point, we've built up a lot over the last couple of years, so we may not see expense growth necessarily as our revenue growth. So we would see the benefit of operating leverage going forward, but it's hard to say whether there would be reduction sort of in absolute dollar terms of the expense levels.","The respondent acknowledges ongoing efforts to maintain expense discipline and efficiency, suggesting that while future expense reductions are uncertain, recent investments in infrastructure may lead to improved scalability and operating leverage without necessarily increasing expenses in absolute terms.",1,0,0.999999,0.09999999,2,2,0,0.39999996,4,0,0.99999975,0.055555555,18,7,0.439999982,0.347222217,0,0,0,1,0,0

At a high level, as I just said earlier, the two primary uses for our cash haven't changed, and as I understand, even after the end of my tenure, they won't change. They remain investment in our organic growth, seeding new strategies, and then share repurchases. Between the two, it would sort of really have to be opportunistic and see what opportunities present themselves, whether in terms of opportunity to seed something if the client is looking for a new product from us and also being vigilant about market conditions and with regard to share repurchases. So it's hard to put sort of a relative prioritization of the two, but those two remain the primary and almost exclusive uses for the cash.","The primary uses of cash for the remainder of the year will continue to be investment in organic growth and share repurchases, with decisions being made opportunistically based on market conditions and opportunities.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Could you maybe give us a little update on the institutional pipeline, like composition, magnitude, time to funding, maybe geography?","Hi, John. Yeah, I guess we are pleased with the pipeline. Of course, as we saw in the numbers in the third quarter, the pipeline has been good, and then we are working through it, and as it sort of progresses, some of it has been converting into sales. So, and it's pretty healthy, it's pretty robust, and it goes across, just like John, it goes across geographies, it goes across strategies, so it's not concentrated in any particular areas, and we are also seeing good response from some of the newer areas, like we have an enhanced strategy that has a low, essentially that offers a low tracking error to indices, but also with low risk. So, I think we're happy with that, with how things are going in the pipeline. Also, we saw some outros from managed volatility in this quarter as well, so we have pockets of risk as well. So, I would say on balance, we are satisfied with where things are that we expect to essentially ideally be positive flows, or maybe at breakeven as we look forward to the next few quarters.","The institutional pipeline is strong and diverse, with positive sales conversion and good responses across various geographies and strategies.

We're definitely, the areas that we're looking to expand into, credit and equity alternatives, and we've got some other product variants in the mix.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Just curious in your dialogue with the board, among others, maybe you could just elaborate on the new strategy, what prompted it, and what is the scope for strategic alternatives from here and the past. You guys have looked to pursue maybe potential buyers. Just curious what the reception feedback has been. Seems like the change in strategy is moving on from the strategic alternatives chapter to the organic growth chapter next.","Thank you for the kind word, Mike. Appreciate it. I would say there's really nothing new, I would say. There isn't necessarily a change of strategy. As we've said for a while, that we remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and looking at all possible ways that we can do that. That strategy remains the same. The company remains open to strategic alternatives. I wouldn't say that's no longer an option or that's off the table. What we've done over the last few years has really moved from the conglomerate approach, singular integrated asset management approach. This is the most unique and well positioned business to do that with. We accomplished this almost a year and a half ago. Then we've remained open to strategic alternatives. Of course, the partner has to be right. At the same time, we continue to optimize our position as an independent public company and continue to be disciplined and expense. We've had leadership succession at Acadian in the interim as we updated. We've been really continuing to be optimized on all fronts as an independent public company, as well as we remain open to strategic alternatives. I would say nothing has changed, but this is just a continued execution of the strategy we've had for a while. This is sort of in a way a culmination of that effort. Going forward, the company is very well positioned as an independent company, but also open to if something synergistic came along that creates shareholder value. The company remains open to that.","The response clarifies that there is no significant change in the company's strategy, which continues to focus on maximizing shareholder value while remaining open to strategic alternatives.

In terms of third-party client assets, traction, interest from clients, and how you're thinking about the scope for maybe bringing some newer strategies to the marketplace over the next year or so.","Certainly. I would say the new strategies have been moving along completely on the expected line. I appreciate that looking from outside in, it's sort of really hard to tell what's been going on because with anything new, when you can't see necessarily a lot of flows, it's hard to tell. With new strategies in our institutional long-only asset management business, the length of the track record is quite important before we start to see meaningful sales numbers. But the execution has been going along well and kind of more or less on the lines we expected. We built the teams, we built the models, we built the necessary technological changes we had to do. And we've been having great conversations with clients who have taken a lot of interest, but just for a variety of reasons. They're internal thresholds that people have requirements to see a certain duration, length of track record. So I would say that there's nothing that we're concerned about on the new strategies. It's just moving along, things take awfully long in terms of coming up with new strategies that over time build scales. So that's what I would say that we continue to stay focused on all these new strategies and we're happy with how the execution is going. So it's not that we would want to then start new strategies because we're unhappy with what we're doing right now.

Maybe you could help flush that out.","Yeah, I mean, those two are the uses and it's really, yeah, we haven't made any sort of predetermined allocation between the two.

And if similarly on the redemption side, what you're seeing there, and if you could also just touch upon the pipeline as it looks today, how is that shaping up versus say last quarter?","Yeah, thanks, Michael. As we've touched on, ours is an institutional business, and so some of the numbers can be large, and they are episodic. So there weren't necessarily any patterns to unpack. It was just sort of coincidence, if you will, that we had these large numbers on both sides. On the inflows, it's really almost just really just three large clients that came in. There was a client that was more than a couple billion, another one for a billion, and another one close to a billion. So these really large numbers. And they were assorted strategies. I wouldn't say there were any patterns to unpack in terms of any particular strategy. It was just that the strategies that these clients came in, they came in large numbers. And it happened to be that these three large you know, inflows happened to be in the same quarter. On the outflow side, similar story that we had really a large client, you know, a large client close to a couple billion, another client more than a billion, another client sort of a similar number, different strategies that just happened to be in the same quarter.

And we don't-going forward, if that's sort of, you know, another part of your question, as we've sort of guided in the past few quarters, we see more of a break even to flat cadence that we do have. The pipeline remains healthy across stages. We have a good pipeline across different strategies and across different stages. And we still see some pressures from managed volatility strategies, among others. We see rebalancing going on by clients in these rising equity markets when they take some chips off the table.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Just a follow-up question on capital allocation. Just curious how you're thinking about and planning to sort of approach that as we move it here into the second half and into 25 cash balance. 72 million, I think you mentioned. How should we think about that potentially drawing down, if at all? Just given I know in the past, I think you've mentioned you think about minimum cash level that you need to run the business is meaningfully lower than that.

So you could say that maybe they're close to 50 is for other uses, and as we've said, really the two main uses remain the buybacks and seeding opportunities to accelerate our organic growth. So we remain mindful and opportunistic on both of those fronts. We seeded just in this quarter, as we mentioned in the release, we seeded our third credit strategy which was the U.S. investment grade strategy. So we have a sizable seed pool now, so there might be some recycling that happens within the pool. But still, if we get opportunities to seed more and to see opportunities for organic growth, we might do that, and we'll also look at the buybacks as we go. So there isn't any particular formula we have. We'll remain opportunistic on both.

Yeah, I think the answer was in the first part of your guess. Largely, you know, the mix does impact the fee rate a little bit, because some of our strategies are higher fee and some are lower fee. So clearly, one of the factors was that the emerging markets indices in second quarter did relatively well. They had been lagging for a while. but in Q2, they did better than some of the other indices, EFE and others, and they have higher fees. So that was probably most of it and some other percent takes.","The fee rate increased due to a favorable mix shift, particularly from better-performing emerging markets indices, which typically carry higher fees.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,Just in terms of the share repurchases capital allocation there. Would you expect to see a renewal of the board to renew the share purchase authorization sometime in the near term?,"Yeah, thanks, Ken. Yeah, as I said, the uses for the capital remain or exceeding organic growth opportunities and buybacks. As I said, the excess capital right now is not that much. that is burning a hole in our pocket, so there isn't necessarily, you know, super urgency on that. But, yeah, in due course, we would expect to get new authorization for buybacks.","The question inquires about the potential renewal of share purchase authorization by the board.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,A question on the outlook for further expense control from here and your ability to keep expenses in check.,"Hi, John. Yeah, you know, as we talked about over the last couple of years, we had a lot of expense increases in the last couple of years as we were really investing in our infrastructure. We invested in our trading infrastructure. We added to our investor reporting capabilities. So we were really building out a lot in the sense of making our franchise more scalable. So we have done a fair bit of that over the last couple of years. And at the same time, we also faced pressures from inflation on the cost of data and because inflation was everywhere. So that's abated. So it appears that now having built up a lot over the last couple of years and having faced inflation, we are now in a good position to keep the expenses more or less at these levels, barring, of course, the general increases that you would see, sort of cost of living type of increases, 2%, 3% kind of levels. So that's what I touched on, that we do have the operating leverage As our revenue grows, either from market growth or organic growth, we should be able to keep the operating expenses relatively at these levels, so we should have disproportionate benefit as revenue increases.","The speaker indicates that after significant investments in infrastructure and facing inflationary pressures, they are now positioned to maintain expenses at current levels, with only minor increases expected.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,Maybe could you give us a little color on the conversations you're having with clients about potentially a pickup in demand for emerging market strategies?,"Yeah, there are sort of a variety of opinions and depends on also the type of client. As you can imagine, many clients view that as sort of, you know, because there's always rotation in terms of highest performance markets and emerging markets have been lagging for such a long time. So many clients view that as an opportunity and whose time may be coming soon, if you will. just the levels of valuations overall in emerging markets, in China in particular. So we're seeing that. On the other hand, there may be some clients who are a little bit worried about the geopolitical situation and worry about the risks, particularly. And then there are some political factors from state clients So it's a mixed bag, but I think, you know, everything said and done so far, we haven't seen much of a pattern either in terms of a lot of inflows or a lot of outflows. We are seeing inflows in that strategy. It's a strategy that we really have excellent, very, very strong top performance. So if somebody does want to allocate, we would have really one of the best chances. um and so we're seeing inflows in that strategy we're also seeing some outflows.","Clients have mixed opinions on emerging market strategies, with some viewing it as a potential opportunity due to lagging performance and favorable valuations, while others express concerns about geopolitical risks.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Just curious, any additional color you can give on cash usage and how we should think about it in the year ahead. What's the minimum level of cash that you feel like you can run with and also how should we think about use of excess capital?","Yeah, thank you. I guess as we said, we have about 100, a little more than 100 million currently at the end of March. And we are mostly almost pretty close to done with 100 million authorization we had previously. We have about 15 million left on the authorization. So I guess if you just go through the 100 million, yet we think about 25 million of operating cash that we'd like to keep as a minimum. There's the 15 million left on the buybacks, so that's 40. I mentioned earlier that we seeded 15 million for our second strategy on our credit platform for the global high yield strategy. So that's another 15 million, that's 55 million. So I think we're left with about 40 million or so from a use perspective and we'll look to buybacks. We also would look to seed some more products on the systematic credit platform. We would target fourth quarter to seed our investment grade strategies, both to US and global strategies, but we'll also generate more cash in the interim and we'll try to recycle some existing seed as well. So in general, I guess those are the round numbers and we add more cash, but it will be used for buybacks and seeding purposes.","The speaker indicates they currently have over $100 million in cash, with a minimum operating cash target of $25 million.

Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"And maybe as a follow-up, just curious your thoughts on pursuing something more programmatic in terms of buybacks rather than opportunistic, thanks.","Thank you. Yeah, currently we are leaning in favor of opportunistic. The reason being that gives us more flexibility in the timing of seeding as well. And also to benefit from the movements in the market. And it's not a large amount now that would necessitate anything programmatic. So we'll feel comfortable with the opportunistic approach for now.","The respondent prefers an opportunistic approach to buybacks for greater flexibility and market advantage, rather than a programmatic strategy, as the current amount does not warrant a more structured plan.",0,1,-0.999999,0.090909083,2,0,0.9999995,0.181818165,1,2,-0.333333222,0.142857136,7,0,0.999999857,0.333333317,1,0,0,0,0,1
Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Could you maybe talk about some of the other strategic areas that are inflowing, that are blunting the outflows from ManageVal and then separately, what type of environment do we need to get to where we could see less of a drag from ManageVal?","Yeah, thanks John. So we are seeing good sales across most of our strategies outside of ManageVal. And I would say there's a little bit of slowdown on the emerging market strategy as well. Given that those markets, the index itself hasn't done very well in recent years compared to the US market. But we saw good sales in global equity strategy in equity non-US strategies and different types of niche strategies such as small cap strategies. We're also seeing demand from our variance of strategies such as extension strategies where we go a little bit long and short, 130, 30 strategies. And we have enhanced versions where they go close to the benchmark with a smaller tracking error. And then there's some ESG as well. So it's pretty good cross section of strategies where we see sales and where we see pipeline building up. And then we are seeing the outflows from ManageVal and a little slowdown in emerging markets. I guess an environment to the last part of your question. On the environment, ManageVal does well when beta is not running up too much. I guess when there's more of a fair risk return environment and it does well over longer periods in the sense that the academic studies and statistics will tell you that over longer periods, 10 years, 15 years period, the low beta securities do just as well as high beta if not better. And that generally holds out to be true. But in the interim, whenever there's a risk on environment, beta of course gets rewarded. So I guess in a more of a risk off environment or more regular environment over longer periods, those strategies do well. But we haven't had that in a while over the last several years, maybe almost 10 years now. It's been a beta rewarding market. So that's not been an ideal environment for ManageVal.","The response highlights that while ManageVal is experiencing outflows, other strategies, particularly in global equity and niche areas, are seeing good sales. For ManageVal to perform better, a more stable risk-return environment is needed, as it thrives when low beta securities are favored over high beta ones, which has not been the case in recent years.",0,1,-0.999999,0.071428566,0,3,-0.999999667,0.214285699,5,4,0.111111099,0.078260869,15,11,0.153846148,0.226086955,3,0,0,6,0,0
Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"And then could you give us kind of a characterization of the institutional pipeline, where things are in it as far as early or late. And then anything chunky on the institutional side, you have line of sight that might be redeeming in the next couple quarters?","Yeah, the pipeline is good. It's in line of what I described, that it's a good cross section that we'd like to see across different types of strategy. ManageVal being notably absent. Emerging markets is less than where we would like. The investment performance is stellar in emerging markets. But the client interest is a little bit less right now because for several years, the emerging market index has lagged. US in particular, but also developed markets in the West. But otherwise, other than that, it's a pretty good cross section and across stages as well, early stage, mid stage and one stages that are yet to be funded. But yeah, you said it right that there are, on the outflow side, we have pressure from ManageVolatility and there are always episodic things that happen with clients reallocating to other things. One thing that we've seen with the high rate environment is a continued trend of de-risking, particularly by pension plans, where the interest rates now are high enough that they can de-risk from equities and allocate more to fixed income. So that those allocation decisions happen from time to time. We're seeing that and people move from one strategy to the other from time to time. So it's a little bit hard to tell, but I guess from a trend perspective, the de-risking and allocation to fixed income, we see that more often. So when you sort of look at all of that, we expect to be probably flattish over next few quarters, but any given quarter, we may see more of these things happening coincidentally in one quarter where we may not come out flat. But these are the trends and that's specifically why we're excited about our fixed income, the systematic credit initiative, because then we can also be a beneficiary of the de-risking trend that we see.","The institutional pipeline is generally strong, with a diverse mix of strategies, though emerging markets are currently underperforming in client interest. There is a trend of de-risking from equities to fixed income due to high interest rates, which may lead to fluctuations in allocations over the next few quarters.",0,1,-0.999999,0.071428566,3,0,0.999999667,0.214285699,1,1,0,0.017699115,15,9,0.24999999,0.212389379,2,0,0,7,0,0
Acadian Asset Management Inc.,Q1 2024,Financial Services,Wonder if you could share some thoughts around potential EBITDA generation going forward and perhaps provide any color around your expense outlook and whether you could see some benefit from operating leverage as markets potentially continue to appreciate. Thanks.,"I can, yeah, that's a good question. And if you look at essentially this quarter versus the year ago quarter, we saw the benefit of the operating leverage in the sense the market's appreciated compared to the year ago quarter, the AUM is up by about 12% and as a result, the management fee was up by about that much, about 12, 13%, but at the E&I level, the E&I is up 48% versus year ago. And then we juiced it a little bit more with our buybacks. So then the EPS is up 57%. So that's primarily because of the benefit of the operating leverage and continued expense discipline. So as we sort of go forward, I guess the markets continue to appreciate, we should see that benefit with the revenue going up and we're generally trying to hold, be disciplined on the expenses. Over the last few years, we invested a lot in making our infrastructure more scalable. We had some initiatives on outsourcing that provides us more scalability without having to add a lot more to the cost. We dealt with the pressures from inflation, particularly on the data costs and IT costs, that should be abating now. And we built up on these new initiatives that are more or less at full run right now. So we see much less increase on the operating expenses going forward, being that we invested in scalability in the past few years. So the markets go up, we should see the benefit of operating leverage. Does that answer your question, Ken?","The respondent highlighted that EBITDA generation is expected to benefit from operating leverage as markets appreciate, with a 12% increase in assets under management leading to a similar rise in management fees.

This is Bill. For 2024, we expect the fee rate, it'll continue to be mixed dependent. In 23, as you know, we experienced organic growth in lower fee products, such as money markets, muni SMAs, while seeing an outflows in higher fee active equities. So, I mean, we're going to continue to be dependent on the markets, on interest rate movements during the year, and investor risk and return appetite.

I was just curious if you could give us a range of kind of what your expectations for the flows are organic growth for the year.","Yeah. Uh, hi, Alex is owner. Um, thanks for the question. Yes, we remain confident about our sales growth in 24. We have good momentum starting the year on the sales front, and this is wide-based in multiple businesses as a continuation of the last few years. We delivered positive five consecutive years of organic growth in U.S. retail. We delivered three years of organic growth in private wealth. As you know, the Asia extra-pan taxable fixed income had a very strong momentum as well. So a number of our strong engines are humming, so we feel very good about the sales prospects.

AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.  Units,Q4 2023,Financial Services,"One of the products you mentioned in private credit was around, I think, non-traded BDC that you're likely to launch this year that will be more broadly disseminated. I guess when you look at that part of the market, it's gotten really crowded over the last 12 to 18 months. There are some established players. There are some traditional firms that are entering the market with new products. What gives you confidence, I guess, that this is the right time to go after that opportunity?

AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.  Units,Q3 2023,Financial Services,"So your munis business continues to demonstrate organic growth strength in the quarter. And I think the SMA wrapper is really probably one of the bigger factors there. But do you expect muni bond flows to reaccelerate further once the markets get confidence that interest rates have peaked? Because while your flows are really good, industry flows haven't really gotten good yet.","Thanks, Craig, and good morning. Look, I think that the street generally was too quick to call the turn in rates. So we've seen, you know, we've seen fixed income continue to trail year to date as rates have continued to back up. And so it's certainly understandable to me why we haven't seen industry flows and munis or taxable, frankly, more broadly, grow much larger. Because for the first time since the financial crisis, holders actually have yield to supplement the diversification. My own way of thinking, Craig, to hit your point square on is I actually think we should see broader industry positive flows and munis as rates stay elevated and inflation gets more under control. Because frankly, demographically, we have incredible demand from clients for income in their portfolios. They take great comfort. And frankly, muni credit quality is so high and muni credit decay is so slow. I think it's going to be a winning area. When that exactly happens, when the Fed is actually on pause, We'll see.

We had our first anniversary in September, and we hit almost a billion dollars of AUM, which is a very good launch, which puts us, I think, one out of five in terms of successful launches in this space. We have multiple paths to success in our view. It's not only our proprietary channel, Private Wealth. We have actually got a lot of good wins in third-party channels. In terms of the vision, I think the vision is three parts. One, complement our vehicle agnostic strategy with active ETFs where that vehicle agnostic strategy helps clients. So we touched on MUNI area in the previous question, for instance. So we are complementing our MUNI SMAs with ETFs. So that definitely is an additive strategy, helps with our momentum. So definitely that vehicle extension is one part of the strategy. Second part of the strategy is opening new doors. Obviously, our space is a heavy user of ETFs. Historically, they were passive ETF users, but we are seeing more and more interest in the active ETF wrapper from those channels, so that helps us open new doors. And then finally, there's still a broader set of opportunities in institutional, including insurance clients, when you achieve certain threshold in terms of AUM, et cetera, given the liquidity of fixed income ETFs, for instance.

As owner, I'll add two minor points. Number one, in fixed income, obviously, we have a strong Asia taxable fixed income franchise in retail. That tends to be pretty high fees in the about 50 basis points level for American income. and definitely even higher for global high yields. Within fixed income, we participate in high fee categories, particularly in Asia. So that should be factored in, number one.

In my view, we're much closer to the end than to the beginning, of course, stating the obvious in the Fed's cycle. And as Wednesday's comments from Chair Powell, I think, indicated, And so I do think people are increasingly confident. We're seeing interest not just from Asian investors, Asian retail investors, to begin to reallocate back. And it's been pretty consistent for us for a while now. But we're also seeing, interestingly, public institutional demand as well. and we're seeing it even in the insurance space where we see opportunities for them to extend duration and credit.

But Actually, just given the trends in the economic reporting that we've seen of late, it seems less likely that that's the risk we're facing.

It's the owner again. I will just add, obviously, market share gains matter. As Seth pointed out, we continue to gain market share in segments of fixed income, particulate tax exempt in U.S. retail. And our expansion of vehicles should only help that, both on the different flavors of SMAs, particularly the customized SMAs in tax exempt that has strong distribution followership, as well as the growing range of ETFs, which are off to a very good start, as Seth mentioned in his remarks.

So what factors are really driving that delta? And how sustainable do you think these share gains are into 2024?","Absolutely. So we believe we have structural strengths and advantages. This is supported by a number of factors. Number one, we invested significantly in our fixed income technology all the way from trading on to the back-end portfolio construction. So as a result, we believe we have a differentiated set of technologies that makes our SMA platform very competitive. On back of those technical capabilities and strength that's recognized by the market, we have been expanding our distribution relationships, not only in our traditional distribution partners in the national wires, as well as regional broker-dealers, but There is definitely growing uptake from RIAs, which is definitely a high growth channel for us.

Hi, Onur, again. In terms of the retail equity strength, it goes back to some of the investments we are making across different vehicles. I touched on already SMAs and ETFs, but another structural strength category for us has been CITs, where we increasingly deploy commingled investment trust kind of structures with our retail partners, which is a very persistent business with typically low redemption rates given the high duration of defined contribution assets in retail.

You're absolutely right in terms of the higher Net growth channels have been our Asia X Japan franchise with taxable fixed income, as well as our U.S. retail and private wealth business. On the institutional side, we have seen an uptick in the demand for U.S. high yields, and that kind of played into the sales and the pipeline.

Obviously, it's hard to predict all the terminations, so hard to be very precise on the net flows, but we are pleased with the momentum in the client dialogue around global credits as well as U.S. high yields in the coming quarters. Scott, if I can just add to that, and I think the other trend we did see in 2021 was more of the money that left from retail, whether that be US retail or offshore retail. So I think that cohort was under risk or underweight of fixed income. And I think that's the first flow that we've started to see back in the last five or six months. On the institutional side, we continue to see steady inflows from defined benefit plans who are in the process or many are in the process of de-risking.

So between the price increases, the underwriting actions, and the moving up in the tower, all of that helps to improve our expectations around profitability from those business units. We're keeping an eye on those things going forward, and we'll be careful in our picks to not reflect any kind of favorable impact until we actually see it. So we hope that we'll be conservative in our picks just because we're hoping to see those things come through, but ultimately we're looking at improvement there from those things.","The improvement in specialty casualty is attributed to price increases, underwriting actions, and moving up in the tower, which collectively enhance profitability expectations.

You know, some claims also, you know, in crop from last year also. So I think the big change was really around a few states like Ohio and Minnesota where the soybean yields were substantially different than what the industry was modeling and, you know, what we were modeling in that area. The corn prices and soybean prices were down, I think, 11% and 13% or something like that for corn and soybeans. That was because our average deductible of farmers was about 22%. I think as we were in the summer and in the fall, you know, reflecting on that, you know, we felt very optimistic. We were headed towards a better year. I think that it's the yield variability state by state that you don't know about until you actually get the claims and you settle them. So I think that was probably the biggest difference, you know, that's really happened through year end and early on this year.","The impact of crop changes, particularly in Ohio and Minnesota, significantly affected soybean yields and overall claims settlement, with corn and soybean prices dropping by about 11% and 13%, respectively.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"A number of companies or a handful of companies, sorry, have been proactively disclosing that they've been adding to their IB&R, so in Kerbinat reported bucket of reserves over the past year or two in light of just a rising trend line, especially in social inflationary lines. Just curious if you'd be able or willing to kind of give us a flavor of whether AFG has, Creative American and American Financial Group has also been adding to that bucket as a percentage of historical levels.","So when you look at our businesses, it's really business unit by business unit as an addition to looking for rate increases in the social inflation exposed businesses and getting them there, we also have changed some terms and conditions, so it can be a little tricky to analyze the IB&R when, for example, in an excess business, maybe the attachment point is different than it was before, so it's not exactly the same product as what you might have seen in previous years, but we look at each business unit, the reserve position of each business unit every quarter and react to new information very quickly, particularly negative news. That process can result in favorable or adverse development for any business unit in any quarter. We've just been fortunate to have more favorable development than adverse development in those periods. This particular quarter, we did see some elevated large losses in our umbrella and excess liability businesses and reacted to that, and to the best that we can, we would reflect new information into all of our Accident of the Year picks, so that can cause us to elevate our picks and then book some IB&R, but I think in looking at the IB&R versus case reserves, there's lots of factors going into it that you can't just really give a number.","The question inquires whether American Financial Group (AFG) has increased its Incurred But Not Reported (IB&R) reserves in response to rising social inflation trends, similar to other companies.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Craig, I believe you made prepared remarks saying you think the alternative investment portfolio can eventually get back to 10% plus returns, but you can correct me if I'm wrong. Just curious, is the market normalizing in terms of fundamentals for real estate, and is that kind of a, you're becoming just incrementally more confident that in the course to come, you'll get kind of back to the target returns?","Sure, let me start out by giving you my view of the more traditional private equity investments. Hard to predict the returns, but certainly a strong market, stock market should favor marks on the traditional private equity investments. Now let me switch to multifamily and give you my view. So multifamily represents a little less than half of our alternative investments, and the operations have held up just fine. We're projecting that for the year, even with the new supply coming into the market, our NOI will be flattish with last year. We did incur some negative marks. Our general partners do marks every quarter on the properties that we've invested in, and because of increased cap rates that are driven by higher interest rates, we did incur some negative marks that we booked in the first nine months of the year. We do benefit from having very attractively priced fixed rate debt on 54 of our 58 properties. I think the average rate on those 54 properties, the loans on 54 properties is around 4% or just over 4%. We're unlike, we're different than some others in that we do have good protection because of the financing that we have in place. Let me give you my view of the multifamily business. Multifamily starts now at a 10 or 11 year low. So we've had a lot of new building in the last couple of years, a lot of new supply coming on stream. I think the peak of that is probably right now, probably the third quarter and fourth quarter is the peak of multifamily completions. Given that new starts are at a 10 or 11 year low, there's been a couple of point in time, probably toward the end of next year, where the new supply is going to be absorbed, and we're gonna once again have very strong pricing power. So I think it probably takes another nine months, 12 months or so to absorb the new supply that's coming on the market. I do think that toward the end of next year, when there is going to be very little new supply hitting the market, that the pricing power will again be very strong. One of the things that has changed here recently is clearly there is significant buying interest in multi, multi family properties again. That has changed here in the last couple of months. We just signed an agreement to sell one of our properties. It's a property in Colorado that we agreed to sell at a 460 cap rate based upon trailing 12 months in a Y, which we found pretty attractive. And we are seeing some transactions now for the first time in a while. That's kind of my view of multi family and kind of what we expect in the next year or so.","Craig believes that the alternative investment portfolio could eventually return to over 10% returns, citing stability in multifamily operations despite some negative marks due to rising cap rates.

I don't know if you have any comments on that. Property and transportation, I don't know if you might've given us an update.

Could you please talk about what accent years that was from and maybe size the magnitude?,"Hi, this is Brian. I think when you look at our casualty businesses, I think the first thing to kind of anchor in on is the results overall, where our casualty group has a combined ratio of 90% for the third quarter and 88.4 for the first nine months. With those kinds of combined ratios, that's always in the high 20s or better. So it's a really good result overall for our casualty businesses. But if you just want to focus in on the table of development there and still in that favorable development, as we noted, we did have continued good favorable development out of workers' comp, but we had that offset by some of the social inflation exposed businesses. And it is large loss activity over a number of years. So it's not just the older years. It is a little bit in some of the more recent years. We're talking about it because it is reducing our favorable development overall, but the results in general are very good.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"In terms of the pulling back in certain lines of business, especially the social inflationary lines, what's changed versus a quarter or two ago that's causing the pullback? And if you're continuing to see loss of prices in excess of loss trend, but now you're pulling back, does that mean that there are certain lines where there's either more uncertainty in loss trend or maybe pricing just isn't meeting loss trend in certain social inflationary lines?","Yeah, I think it's some of all the above, you know, that you mentioned. Again, you know, we fastidiously do quarter-by-quarter reviews, actuary of all of our businesses and that, and, you know, we're continually adjusting prices you know, our quarterly loss ratio trends according to what we're seeing.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,I know commercial auto pricing had really accelerated in recent quarters to pretty high levels. Did you give us an update on how that's trending currently in the portfolio?,"Sure. Um, I think I just mentioned in the script that in the quarter, you know, commercial auto liability increases were about 16% on top of 21%. In our case, you know, when we look at year-to-date or overall commercial auto results in that, we kind of break even to a small underwriting profit overall. It's a commercial auto liability line that has a small underwriting loss in that. So, you know, we're particularly focused, uh, you know, with workers comp with national interstate, you know, the business is a really good, um, you know, really solid underwriting profit. We're focused on the commercial auto liability, uh, part of our part of the business and the, uh, what, where the loss ratio trends are higher. I think for that reason, um, that's why, you know, we're getting a double digit plus, um, price increase. And, uh, You know, I think we're also looking to make other, you know, underwriting adjustments over time. We're serious about wanting to improve our commercial auto and particularly our commercial auto liability results. Now, you know, at a small underwriting profit break-even, we have a solid return on equity in that business, and with the workers' comp, in the transportation business, you know, we're making a very good return. I think our results are probably five or six points better is what our guys would, would tell me then, you know, the industry. So, but we, you know, we're an underwriting focused company and, you know, we'd like to see the commercial auto liability and the overall commercial auto, you know, at more of a, a solid underwriting profit in that. Does that help?","The commercial auto pricing has seen significant increases, with liability rates rising by 16% on top of a previous 21%.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"If there were material crop reserve releases, is that unusual in terms of seasonality? And what is the seasonality on crop, if you can remind us, releases and what happened?","Yeah, Brian can add some color on that, and I can add additional color on crop here in a minute also. So on the profit emergence for crop, we tend to book the profit in that business when the crops come out of the ground. And for the corn and soybeans, the main products, that's sort of at the end of the year. So when we're booking our crop profit, it tends to be heavily weighted into the fourth quarter. but there's still a lot of crop business to be settled after that so we typically have a significant amount of reserves still up at the end of the year and that because we're conservative in our booking that has tended to lead to some favorable development in the first quarter of the subsequent year and then sometimes with some of the products like area coverages and things like that some of that takes a little bit longer to settle so there can be some favorable or adverse development in the second quarter of the year that's kind of the final settlements from the prior crop year. In this particular case, that was a little bit higher level of favorable development this year than last year. So when we talk about favorable development in the property and transportation group, a good chunk of that's coming off of crop, and it's a little bit more than it would have been in a typical second quarter.   Yeah, I'll maybe add a little bit more color on crop overall. When you look at the corn and soybean good and excellent percentages, they're much higher as of the latest USDA report, August 4th, than what they were last year. As far as the current commodity prices, I was just looking, you know, this morning, you know, corn's down 13.6%, soybeans 11.7%. And that's weighed against an average deductible excluding rainfall in our business of around 23%. We don't have a tendency to get too concerned until you start seeing price declines of closer to 20% or so, as it would impact on your losses in that. I think additional positive things at this point is winter wheat, which is I think maybe 8% or 9% of our business, much better much better results this year I think than the prior year the same thing with rainfall and somebody was asking me today and my brother Craig was asking me about Hurricane Debbie and you know how much that might impact on us we think it's probably a non-event as far as the crop business and one particular reason is we do write rainfall you know in Florida so that actually offsets any exposure, you know, that comes out of Debbie. We don't have, we have a very, almost an insignificant amount of our premiums come from, you know, the Debbie affected area in that. So, you know, a little bit additional color there. Overall, again, I think we're very optimistic, you know, about the crop year.","The question inquires about the seasonality of crop reserve releases, and the answer explains that crop profits are typically booked in the fourth quarter, with significant reserves remaining at year-end, leading to favorable developments in the following quarters. Additionally, the current crop conditions for corn and soybeans are better than last year, and despite some price declines, the overall outlook for the crop year remains optimistic.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,4,0.384615355,0.072625698,36,15,0.411764698,0.2849162,1,0,0,7,1,0
"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"In one of your previous answers, you spoke of the favorable development in the property and transportation component, and I think you called out the crop impact there. I'm wondering if you could provide any color to the moving pieces of favorable development in either the casualty business or the specialty finance business.","Sure, Greg. This is Brian. So in the casualty group, we do have net favorable development overall. And what we have going on there, there are things going in both directions. The workers' comp business, which has historically been a source of favorable development for us, has continued to be favorable, similar amounts of favorable development relative to recent quarters. The second quarter of 2023, we had a little bit less favorable development than we've had kind of in the typical quarter, but this quarter was a fairly normal quarter there. There are other areas of favorable development, as Carl mentioned, and things like executive liability and some other areas. But I'll say that is a modest amount of adverse development in different business units. We particularly mentioned an excess liability business, and that really is because that's the only line of business that had any kind of sort of larger amount of adverse development. But even that wasn't a material amount overall. So it's not that we have huge takedowns out of the normal course in workers' comp offsetting other things. It's just that there were small blips in a couple of business units across a couple of accident years in the social inflation exposed businesses there. So overall, we feel really good about where our reserves are and are pleased that we have favorable development overall in that category. In the financial segment, there were ins and outs, but nothing individually material there. So we had some favorable development in some lines, some adverse in others, and it just netted down to a very small amount. But none of those are large amounts going in either direction.","The casualty business is experiencing overall favorable development, particularly in workers' compensation, despite some minor adverse developments in specific areas like excess liability.

But one way we do business in FIS or in our lender-placed property business is a little different than maybe Assurant or some others in that With our producers, you know, we have a sliding scale kind of a commission type of agreements where to a certain extent if the loss ratio is worse in a given year, you know, some of the seeding commission goes down.

This is Brian. So to talk about the casualty segment first, there's a few things going on there. First of all, we did continue to see stable development coming out of our workers' comp business as well as lower severity in our executive liability business. Offsetting that is some increased severity in our excess liability businesses and some increased severity in the social services businesses. When Carl mentioned the lower profitability in the social services businesses, that's coming through prior year development. And it's just on a number of a few claims there. While we don't comment on specific claims, it is over a couple of the more recent accident years. And then in the financial group, there's a small amount of adverse development there and that's related to our innovative markets business where we're seeing a little bit of increased severity there. The innovative markets business includes some coverages related to complex intellectual property.","The speaker discusses reserve development in the casualty segment, noting stable performance in workers' comp and lower severity in executive liability, but increased severity in excess liability and social services.

"American Financial Group, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Got it. And I guess that's helpful. I guess just on the commercial auto liability pricing increase, if I heard that, that kind of jumped off the page at 21%. I guess what did that compare to in the fourth quarter and how should we think about that burning through and impacting your underlying margins and property and transportation as the year goes on?","I definitely think it's a very positive result. I believe for all of 2023, it was around 11%, but I believe the fourth quarter jumped up to around 15% or so. So I definitely like the trend. It's our goal.

Pricing power appears to be going, moving north as the industries and AFGs reserve releases or I guess dissipate a bit. So I guess, does this just feel kind of like the cycles playing out as it does?

I think the first quarter was was very strong in that. I think, you know, different companies talk talk about leaning into the property opportunities. This is a business that we've done very well over a long period of time with significant underwriting profitability. With pricing going up 9 percent with an industry that's focused on getting the proper insured values in their states like Florida and a number of other states that are moving to anybody doing this business doing making sure that things are insured to replacement cost value, not just the the principal balance. Replacement cost value could be appraised value or it could be what's called last known coverage replacement cost, which would have been, you know, maybe somebody's last homeowners policy in that that that was written.

On that question, If you look at where we've seen development by year in casualty, we've seen some adverse development coming out of calendar years 2018 and 2019, so that's consistent with prior periods. If you look at development overall in casualty, we think it's best to look at it for the full year to understand trends. So looking at the full year, I think the first thing to do is to keep in perspective that we're talking about businesses with a calendar year combined ratio for the full year of 87%. with ROEs in the mid-20s, so very strong performing businesses. We discussed in some of the previous quarters, for the full year of 2024, we did have lower levels of favorable development in workers' comp as our initial loss picks have come down in recent years, reflecting our experience and considering some of the price decreases in that business, as well as being mindful about the potential for medical cost inflation going forward.

So we're continuing to achieve price increase. I think I mentioned in the call the couple of areas that I'm not happy with on pricing keeping up with prospective loss ratio trends, public D&O. Like everybody else, we're seeing rate declines on our public D&O book. One thing that's different about us is only about 22% of our D&O book is public D&O and probably 1% of the policy count. So we have a real diversified D&O book. In our case, very pleased with, we have excellent results in our D&O business and might even make a small underwriting profit in public D&O. You know, when you look at 22% and 23. So public D&O, I kind of mentioned, we're not growing a lot because of the competition and kind of particularly the higher excess liability area, particularly in Fortune 1000 accounts.

It would be more of over the long term. My gut tells me that all the new competitors jumping in the public, you know, and excess liability are going to get burned. You know, a lot of them are going to get burned. And this is more of a short-term phenomenon, you know, on rate being below prospective loss ratio trend.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"I was curious if you could comment just as we think about fiscal 2025 guidance, just your general approach to assessing what the credit environment might look like. You obviously continue to control that extremely well, and maybe as part of that in this category of fiscal 25 assumptions, I know you said that B2B and some other newer initiatives, including the Apple Pay Partnership, are not expected to be material, but can you maybe tell us a little bit more about how you guys define material? Because it sounds like there may be something in the numbers for it, but we'd just love to unpack that a little bit.","So in terms of credit, just a friendly reminder to everybody, these numbers are not an accident. We decide what we want to see. Obviously, there is variability, but we have a really short-term exposure. Our consumers don't borrow money from us for too long. Every transaction is underwritten separately. we are by design and definition in control of our credit outcomes. What you see today are the numbers that we wanted to have and we're happy with them. We'll continue to do exactly the same thing. Every time we plan our credit outcomes, we tell ourselves what it is that we want to see in the DQs and that's what we typically end up with, plus or minus minor noise. In terms of setting guidance, we did this last year and we thought we kind of got the right solution or the right formula, and we repeat it again this time. We set the floor. As risk managers, we are inherently conservative people. We like to guide all of you to a number we feel is pretty well-baked. We will get there. And then we turn around and tell the team, we've got to do much better than this. We've got to beat this number. This number is in the bag. Let's go, go, go. Let's do better. That's what happened in fiscal 24. That is our plan for fiscal 25. Now, the thing that makes this a fun place to work at – Lots of things change. There will be something that's going to fall out of our plan for 25 because some really cool opportunity is going to come up and we'll prioritize the opportunity and we'll part ways temporarily with whatever it is that the opportunity will take the place off. None of that is in the guide by design. We are putting in the guide what we think we will get to with a really good degree of certainty. That's the philosophy Michael can probably give you a little bit more polish on. Yeah, and I think you see the growth rate implied in the Q1 guide is obviously those things are reflective of where we're actually seeing progress for initiatives that have shipped and are already contributing, and that's where we're seeing an acceleration in GMB in Q1 so far. I think the broader question around the new initiative, things like B2B and our partnership with some of the wallets, The question of materiality, I should clarify, is little m material, so we're not trying to use any sort of strict definition here. But for us, it would really need to be hundreds of millions, billion dollar type range before we start thinking about it as influencing the trajectory in a material way. And so when we look at a lot of these opportunities, they're either not yet shipped, as is the case with several of our wallet partnerships where they're not live yet. We don't think it's prudent to try to guess the timing of those in terms of their impact. We retain a lot of confidence on how big they will be eventually, but are being very mindful around setting guidance that is stuff that's live in the ground and contributing today or that we have control and direct line of sight to as opposed to things that could take a few quarters to roll out and therefore have more uncertainty to them. the wallet partnerships or any of our international initiatives, we're confident on the size and scale of those or else we wouldn't be spending time on them.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"I guess we've seen the business perform in a rising rate environment. I'm curious how you're thinking about the business in a potentially falling rate environment, and I'm curious around two things, really. Consumer spending, and then I'm thinking about, I know you guys price each transaction uniquely with the APR, and I'm wondering if there may be some benefits to your model versus traditional credit cards where the rates are pegged to the prime rate. Is there any area for play in there in terms of pricing on the way down?","Thanks, Reggie. Great question, as always. There's a huge amount of benefit in not being tethered to a single price that was handed to you in a form of a line that floats precisely with the Fed Funds rate. The coupling is unnatural. We've always said it from the very beginning, this idea that you negotiate your credit card rate even if it's floating kind of once and for all basically and the merchant negotiates their acceptance rates once and for all is foolish. Like we live in the connected real-time world. Why wouldn't we be negotiating these rates in real-time? And that's what we've built and that's why Affirm is successful. That's our innovation. As the rates move writ large, as they go up, obviously we end up having to pass some of the costs through as it hits us to consumers. Practically, would this mean that at some point someone who would have been approved will not be approved because the price is just not the number that we want to put. We have limits. We don't want to go above the Military Lending Act number, and that's a decision we made a long time ago and don't plan to change. As the rates come down, the very first consumer side impact will be better approval rates. Pricing is always fungible. We price things in real time. We can change it as we go. But the most exciting thing about reduction of that funds rate is we'll just have more active users. We'll have more new users. We'll have more repeat users because we'll be able to approve more people. The only thing to add is the rate at which the rates change is very important. We saw a very quick rise in rates as rates went up, and you saw us react to those changing rates on the timeline we talked about. We're very well positioned now to be reactive, such that if they were to move that quickly again, I think we could move very quickly. But that's not in our assumption set. We don't believe that will happen, and I think we're talking about here a change in direction of rates more than the magnitude for the time being. And so very little change in the near term based upon the booths that have already been priced in by the market.","The question inquires about the impact of a potentially falling interest rate environment on consumer spending and pricing strategies compared to traditional credit cards.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"RLTC fell nicely above your range this quarter, and I know you called out a presumably non-recurring $30 million benefit from a single securitization. What are the key puts and takes we need to consider for RLTC performance in 2025? In your internal planning, what are shaping up to be the bigger variables to keep in mind? Do we need to see Fed, you know, rates come down, funding costs come down a certain amount, do we need to see credit performance hanging at certain levels? Where are the pressure points next year?","Yeah, great question. So again, on Q4, we did do a non-consolidated securitization. We don't do those every period. And so when we're able to do them, you do have a little bit of a chunky benefit which pushed us slightly over the 4% range we like to think about as the ceiling. When you take that out, the RLTC rate in Q4 is pretty consistent with the guidance that we gave for Q1. So we think it's pretty stable sequentially. And the big puts and takes are mostly related to mix of business that we are reaching on the platform, and the associated credit outcomes, and then how we execute in the capital markets. I think the team has done a phenomenal job this past 12 months in broadening our access to really attractive capital sources. And that's been done with ABS deals, been done with forward flow deals, and we continue to think there's lots of opportunity for us to do more here. And certainly, if we're able to do that, we can deliver strong margins. We are signing up for a 10 basis point expansion in the RLTC percent of GMV versus last year, and we feel like that's possible because of a lot of the full-year benefit of the work that we've taken on, plus the fact that we do think we're in a very strong position with respect to the capital markets.","The question addresses the impact of a non-recurring $30 million benefit on RLTC's performance and asks about key factors influencing 2025 results.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,The slides called out that the majority of the benefit from pricing initiatives will be realized by the end of this fiscal year. That all makes sense. But wondering if you could quantify how much the pricing initiatives have been helping volume growth in recent periods?,"It's hard to quantify, to be completely honest. We don't couple these measures super tightly, because it's very dangerous to decide that one thing leads to the other. So we have a wider EPR range, obviously, service well in the world of increased rates, but we still underwrite every transaction, we still decide which transaction is going to not, etc. And so I would struggle to put a distinct number on it. Certainly wouldn't want to make any prognostications about the future impact. Obviously, we are very keen on growing. We're still growing really well. We benefit from the pricing quite nicely, but ultimately we are in the risk measurement and management business here. And so we will, first and foremost, do no harm to that as we grow. Maybe I'll add, if you look at the letter, we bridge for you the year-over-year change in our revenue less transaction cost measure. And you can see that the revenue growth roughly offsets the increase in funding costs, other transaction costs, and the incremental provision costs. And the real governor here for us is making sure that we post positive unit economics And so the way to think about it is the revenue was what we needed to offset the change in rates in the business. And we feel like we've done that. It allows us to be back to more business as usual.","The speaker finds it difficult to quantify the impact of pricing initiatives on volume growth, emphasizing the importance of risk management over direct correlations.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Max, you've talked a lot about unbundling the credit card. But elsewhere in the industry, you've got Capital One tying up with Discover and kind of a rebundling of the credit card. So I'd love to get your thoughts on how you think that could impact the industry more broadly, and also if you see this kind of rebundling as a new or unique competitor to a firm in any way.","First of all, I think that it's singularly the most impactful and interesting thing that's happened in financial services probably in the last 10 years. So I think huge goodness to Capital One for seeing the opportunity and executing on it like nothing but extreme respect for the leadership team there for having to go do this. I think creating another network given Discover's reach is especially powerful and lots of good things from their point of view I think to do that. I think any incremental network building whether it's open or not entirely open is a good thing for us because it just creates more plurality in the market and validates the idea, frankly, with even our investors that there's still a chance to build another giant network. That's certainly the business we're trying to have here. I'm not sure the products that are intended to run on top of the newly, whatever the name is going to be, Discover Capital One Network is meant to be any different from what happens currently on Visa and MasterCard. As you know, ours is fundamentally different. We look at SKU-level data and integrate directly with merchants at a much richer degree of bandwidth to make sure that we can underwrite transactions and equally importantly offer EPR subsidies to consumers to motivate purchasing. The network itself is a little bit more of the same, but I do think that the actual deal is a profoundly interesting thing, certainly from the Capital One point of view.","Max views the collaboration between Capital One and Discover as a significant development in financial services, potentially enhancing market plurality and validating the opportunity for new networks.

So just wondering if there's any particular call outs or any plans to tighten underwriting or more cautious view on the consumer or just any additional color there would be great.","I'm sure Michael will have some words in a second, but let me tell you how I feel. We don't run the business on a quarter by quarter basis. It is just a fundamentally wrong way to look at a payments company that wants to be around 100 years from now. What do you do next quarter? We're trying to grow. We're trying to make sure that we grow really well yet carefully. We take risk. But most importantly, the fact that we have a forecast to share with you or a guide to share with you for next quarter has fairly little impact on our planned growth initiatives on some randomly chosen time boundary that is not measured in quarters. So I think it's just really important to know that I certainly do not think of Q4 numbers from a growth point of view. You definitely care about other numbers like risk, et cetera. That's really important. But growth is measured in years, and that's really how we think about it from the product point of view.   Yeah, and then just a couple of things about the quarter. So fiscal Q4 is a seasonally stronger quarter. We see strength in categories like travel ticketing, and you see that reflected in our guide. Our guide at the high end does imply faster year-on-year growth in Q4 of this year than we had in last year. So it's a year-on-year acceleration in growth. And of course, last year the Q4, as you point out, was a pretty tough comp because it grew quite quickly from Q3. Some context there, as we called out in our shareholder letter last year, we did have some new deals with travel merchants like Cafe Pacific and Booking.com. And we had some expansion projects with merchants like Royal Caribbean, And, yes, we also launched the adoption of 36% APR caps in many merchants. All those things contributed to a really strong Q4 last year, making the comp quite hard.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"I wanted to also ask just on Affirm Card, I think it said in the shareholder letter that the recent cohorts are actually using the product more than some of the initial cohorts. I think conceptually we might have thought that the early adopters would kind of be the heaviest users, but just curious to get your take on that, Max. And then just any thoughts you guys might have on how Card GMV might trend in Q4.","So great question. And that is definitely something I keep a much closer eye on than even quarterly measure. This is a day by day, week by week. My last conversation before I walked into this one was with one of our card readers right outside this room, just to give you a sense for where I spend my time. So you're totally right. It would stand to reason that early adopters would just convert and put our card on top of their wallet and go, go, go, and you should see some normalization. That has not happened. I didn't necessarily predict it that way, but the reason for it is simple. I didn't say it, one of the analysts said it, but it's a unique product. Every time you launch a unique product, you are teaching the market, or teaching the consumer anyway, a bunch of new modalities that they have not experienced yet, which is for some people a fool's errand, for some people a vision that they're trying to pursue. I hope I'm in the latter, but perhaps sometimes in a former category too. As you offer the product to the market, you get consumer feedback. And we have a million cards out there now with lots and lots of feedback, and some people love it, and some people have issues, which we are very attentive to. The last quarter, we launched an uncountable number of tweaks and fixes to the user interface, most importantly, and just made the card more and more comprehensible and accessible. easy to use and easier to understand and just eliminating surprise user experiences and, and, and. And so as we do that, we find another point, another three points of usage where people say, oh, okay, so now I get what I'm supposed to do in a gas station or now I'm supposed to do this in a restaurant. And these are real examples. Like a restaurant – Pay later mode is a little bit trickier because you might leave a tip. And so the number you see on your bill is not the same number, etc. And so as we just go and make the card smoother and smoother, we find new usage. That's why we think the usage increased. One interesting stat, we were roughly 6% pay now last quarter. We are closing in on 10% pay now this quarter. Still, incidentally, those are not top of wallet numbers. That's still climbing, but that's a really good clip, and we're going to keep growing until we get more.

In terms of the RLTC rate, the take rate on a percentage of GMV, it's really mix and macro. So the mix of business across our merchant base and the products that we offer there.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Can you comment either Max or Michael just on kind of how underwriting and risk are factoring into that strength and then the corollary I guess or the follow on would be around tender share, your enterprise customers and it appeared to be elevated during the holidays and I just wonder if that's a sign of accelerating tender share to come or aspirational tender share growth.","The underwriting settings, so the single most I would say accelerated change we've conducted to our, as we call it, box was really more of a year and a half ago than a year ago. April of 22 is when we saw real stress on the consumer and we reacted to that sort of within the next 60 days or so. We've since really not done an enormous amount of significant steering. We change marginal cutoffs on a merchant by merchant, category by category, product by product basis all the time and also change things like allowed terms as in durations, required down payments, et cetera. So we managed credit very, very actively since the beginning of time for us but there's not been a major change to our posture in the last year and a half. The numbers that we printed just now are not an accident. We drove them to be what they are very, very deliberately and I don't want anybody to sort of assume that we're hands-off and the numbers just print themselves. It's a lot of work and we care quite a lot where they end up. We have certain expectations we've set with capital markets and we intend to continue delivering those expectations. So that's first and foremost and that governs a lot of our metrics as output to that. The tender share, share wallet as we call it internally has done really well over the holidays. We've generally been gaining wallet share although the stories are different category to category and in some cases merchant to merchant. We feel very good about some of the things that we announced. Obviously offline we were not a noticeable player until recently and between the card and some of the offline self-checkout kiosks really powerful and then just sort of call out one particularly strong performance over the holidays especially and overall in the last quarter Shopify has just continued to perform extraordinarily. The growth of that particular partnership is accelerating three plus years into the partnership. That set of products grew about twice the speed of the rest of a firm. So it's just a story of success to success and we still have a lot of things that we have not scaled out. They have their own offline aspirations that we're obviously very excited to be a part of et cetera. So it's a little bit of it and I'm giving a very long-winded answer here but frequency for us is being where consumer shops and share of tender comes as a consequence of being available and being able to support the various consumer needs that as we encounter them. And the only thing I'd add is we did with the 36% APR caps that we were able to get in place we were able to be more expansionary in a number of places. That is completely done now and so we wouldn't expect any more volume benefit there although there is still some margin benefit we think that will come as the program continues to roll out and scale but we wouldn't expect any more volume there because of 36.","The response discusses how underwriting and risk management have been actively adjusted since April 2022 to respond to consumer stress, emphasizing that recent performance metrics were achieved through deliberate efforts rather than passively.

Let's see what other surprises. I don't like surprises, Reggie. I feel like anytime somebody surprises me I'm not gonna like the outcome. Actually, I'll give you one very surprising fact which is a little bit of an inside view but we have very noticeably accelerated our ability to ship software and I had anticipated some of that but I'm quite surprised at how productive the teams have been on the engineering side, on product side, on design side, percolates down to revenue. Generally speaking, I expected that we would rally around the goals especially from the low point of this time last year but if it's a turnaround it's a much faster and more aggressive turnaround than I myself expected.","The speaker expresses surprise at the rapid improvement in their team's productivity and software delivery, which has positively impacted revenue, while also acknowledging Shopify's strong performance.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Just looking at the seasonal patterns of your margins, the back half of the year tends to be better than the front half of the year and when I look at your full year guidance for your operating margin, I guess it implies, even third quarter, I think it implies a pretty substantial sequential increase in expenses below the RLCC line. What's driving that and where should we see that show up? Is it a marketing thing, is it technology? My rough math was almost like 20 million in a sequential increase there. I'm not sure if that's right or not but you can comment on that a little bit, that would be helpful.","Yeah, we don't provide a specific guidance number for there so sometimes the way in which we build our guidance can lead to a little bit of exaggeration on that as you calculate it but that's right and there's a couple factors to think about. Firstly, and this will sound very trivial but I promise you it does actually end up becoming pretty big, we do expect there to be a lot more payroll tax associated with stock-based compensation in our first quarter both because people have reset their tax obligations to with the new year but also because the share price is higher and both those two things will create a little bit of the sequential bump from quarter to quarter and then we remain really excited about the opportunities that are ahead for us and so we're continuing to be thoughtful around where we should be adding resources to go build new products and chase the new opportunities and I think the strength in this quarter's results with respect to our unit economics and operating efficiency give us license to be willing to add a little operating expense whereas I think we've been very cautious to do that until we could demonstrate it.","The question inquires about the expected increase in expenses impacting operating margins in the second half of the year, while the answer explains that the increase is driven by higher payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and a strategic decision to invest in new opportunities due to improved unit economics.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Just thinking about how we head in to the second quarter here, given the outperformance in the first, especially in GMV and volume. What kind of led to the outperformance? And then it looks like the growth rate will decelerate back a little bit after accelerating this quarter in the second quarter. Maybe you can just help us with that.","I think I'll take the why the growth. I think we've just been executing really well. As you saw, just the overall leverage, we are firing on all pistons of the company, which I have to tell you feels very good. We're able to deliver a couple of really key initiatives on the product side. Our friends in Ottawa, in particular, we had several really strong ideas that played out very well for us there. And so the Shopify volume accelerated again, which just sort of speaks to maybe the way we operate the business. It sometimes seems like you sign this great partner and that's the burst of volume. But in reality, it takes us years to fully realize the opportunity for us when partnerships are this rich and with this much potential. So that's one example. Card grew quite well as well, and so we're happy with those results. There's not one thing that I can stick a finger at and say that this is the core reason for the GME growth, but the other thing is that the demand for the product remains strong. We are still declining quite a number of applicants because we're trying to remain as thoughtful and productive in our credit outcomes But the consumer demand for what we have to offer is continuing to pull us forward. The only thing I'd comment on for Q2 is both that it's our largest quarter of the year and so we just have a lot more mass in the comparable period, and we do expect that some of our programs, our largest enterprise partner programs, are continuing to mature in a way that less growth this year than we had before.","The outperformance in the first quarter was attributed to effective execution and strong partnerships, particularly in product initiatives, leading to increased Shopify volume and consumer demand.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Michael, maybe you can talk a little bit about adjusted operating profit. Came in quite a bit ahead of expectations. Is that some timing of expense items that even out throughout the year or anything to call out there for the margin in the first quarter versus for the quarters for the rest of the year?","Yeah, thanks for the question. Yeah, the adjusted operating income did come in well ahead of where we thought it was going to be for the quarter, and I think it shows the power of us and our technology orientation. When we are able to control expenses and drive a little bit of extra growth, the growth and profitability is very, very strong. I think I put it in context. We have 28% GMB growth or 37% revenue growth, and our non-transaction operating expenses reduced significantly on an absolute basis by $50 million year-on-year. When that happens, obviously, you can grant pretty strong results. I think due to our outperformance, we did raise the outlook for the full year. We're now expecting closer to 5%. And I think that we were driving leverage really across all three lines, G&A, sales and marketing, and tech data and analytics. And those lines are all very leverageable in our business. We've been saying this for quite some time, and yet, That's also the area we invest in primarily in human capital. We want to make sure we maintain the ability to invest in the back half of the year, which is why we wouldn't expect to run at this level. But no, there really wasn't any sort of timing benefit. You will expect sales and marketing to creep up a little bit in Q2 as we invest into the holiday season. But other than that, we feel like Q1 was very close to runway before we, again, maintain some room to make some investments in the back half of the year.","Michael discussed the strong adjusted operating profit for the quarter, which exceeded expectations due to effective expense management and significant growth in gross merchandise volume (GMB) and revenue.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"As a follow-up to the first question around shop pay installments, GMV, growth acceleration, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what functionally changes or ramps up over time that allows you to drive this acceleration in GMV over two years since the initial partnership. What can that tell us about how you approach some of these enterprise partnerships?","I'm known to give long-winded answers, so I'll actually try to keep this one shorter. The very shorthand answer is optimization. Both companies are very numerically driven. We spend an incredible amount of energy just EV testing various forms of presentation of the products we offer to consumers, try to simplify things, try to fine tune everything from how do we explain interest if there's interest to pay, how do we make sure people understand that there is no interest in products like paying for Just all of that, and if you have a, one of the sort of obvious truisms, if you will, if you have a significant amount of volume already, even one or two percent increase in end-to-end conversion just creates millions or tens of millions of dollars of incremental GMV. So it's never a, sometimes it is sort of a brilliant unlock where we say, oh, we forgot there's this thing we can try and it works, but nine or ten times it's really just optimizing existing consumer experience finding ways of presenting the offer a little bit more funnily so the consumer understands there is a budget, perhaps more than the budget they realize because we can tell them, here's what we are willing to approve you for, etc. And then just doing that over and over again has compounding effects. The secret sauce is in the work, not in secret.","The key to driving GMV growth over two years in partnerships lies in continuous optimization of the consumer experience, focusing on data-driven adjustments and effective communication of product offerings.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,Maybe just a quick one on our firm card. $224 million of GMV accelerating from the $130 last quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about how you're approaching driving growth there? The user growth seemed like it was steady at that $75K mark per month and anything you get tell us around the mix of firm card GMB and how that may have changed relative last quarter.,"So I don't want to steal too much of Libra show next week To quote my favorite movie. I'd love all of you to come and give me notes When we do investor forum a week from now but the shorthand is The mix remains largely in line with what we said last quarter. It's still more split pay or split transactions versus paying full. We'll talk a lot about things like cohort retention and usage over time and a little bit about lifetime value next week. There's a lot to share and I don't want to spoil the party too much. The growth is quite strong. It is managed to the number that we want. We have internal goals that we are driving card numbers to. We want to run out of opportunities there for some time. We also want to make sure that we don't paint ourselves into a corner in the following sense. The product is a new idea. This is not something that existed before. lots of intellectual property protection around some of the stuff that we invented, both kind of what meets the eye and what's under the hood there. And every time you launch a new product, even if it has exceptional uptake, which we think this one does, you are educating a consumer. You have to look for long-term effects. One of my many nighttime jobs is to read consumer feedback that comes to me directly from the card, and it's now a very steady stream of content. And a lot of it is about getting in touch with our PMs and saying, hey, there's this wrinkle on the card that people still don't fully understand. How do we fix this? Again, in service of that, let's get 3% more conversion. Let's get 5% more conversion. The card is so new, every time we find some major comprehension unlock, we find ourselves in another 10% gain. So it's gratifying to unblock a fixed mistake we made or unblock a comprehension detail and suddenly have a lot more volume. So we'll continue growing users quite deliberately. We'll be very, very focused on unblocking all the quirks of the user interface, doing all the educating that we have to do before we start sending a card to everybody as they sign up. But over the long period of time, I fully expect to get to a place that is, hey, welcome to Affirm. The card's in the mail. That's not going to happen any time in the immediate or even foreseeable future, but the long-term point of the card is it is the best way of experiencing Affirm.

How should we think about those three forces kind of What's more important to drive growth going forward?,"It's a great question. Thank you, as always. So, as should be already apparent in some of the writing we did, the highest efficiency way for us to grow kind of what constitutes existing business is growth through and with our platform partners. And that's where we really can invest the way we know how to do our best work, building products, building features, figuring out how to partner holistically across very, very large surface areas, you know, Shopify, Walmart, et cetera.

And so part of the work we're doing with the industry and the bureaus is to make sure that it works the right way for the end customer.","The question addresses concerns about the CFPB's push for greater reporting of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) purchases and its potential impact on consumer usage.

If you remember, of course, the last fiscal year is as rates were constantly rising and We're at or near the higher end of that rate cycle and would expect that to play out with respect to some headwinds in the cost side. And to offset that, of course, we have some of our consumer pricing initiatives, which will begin to bear real fruit. And all that is kind of in the top line part of the business.

But I've said many times before, in-store is the next frontier. I think frequency is the single most important thing we can focus on in terms of just building out the network.

Just to recap on how this works, the first step for us is getting any caps in the way, you know, getting the caps out of the way, allowing us to price where we think we need to price, always underneath 36%. we were subject to a number of 30% APR caps, and so one potential way to read that is there's six points. However, we don't intend to price every loan up that amount, and so there is a reasonable limit to expect. That being said, we're about halfway rolled out, and we've got about a point, so I think a fair rule of thumb would be to double our progress today, and that's a good ending spot. In terms of the impact that those pricing initiatives have on approvals is absolutely the case that we get to approve more consumers, drive better conversion for our merchant partners, and grow our business faster by being able to price loans in that zone. And that is our intent. Our intent would be to leverage that to protect asset yields for our investors and still approve more volume. And part of the reason... why we've seen the acceleration in our direct-to-consumer business is because it's how we've been operating it, frankly, since we've been able to get that moved first ahead of any sort of merchant interaction.","Michael discussed a 110 basis point increase in interest-bearing GMV and explained that their pricing initiatives are progressing well, allowing for more flexible loan pricing and increased approvals for consumers.

I know there's always some puts and takes there when I look sequentially at Well, actually, just gross take rate and then net take rate. Maybe you can just help us walk us through between 3Q to 4Q.","Yeah, thanks. We had, obviously, a really strong quarter on revenue-less transaction costs in Q3, driven in large part by our outperformance in credit. That resulted in a pretty large beat ahead of our expectations in the provision for losses. And that was despite operating... in a very volatile capital market. We assume that Q4 will remain volatile. That's not to say that it isn't a spot where we can add capacity. We do intend to add capacity like we do almost every quarter. But it does mean that we're being very thoughtful around what we assume as we prepare a forecast and the guidance that we aren't overly reliant on things getting better in the debt capital markets for us. What that means for us is a little bit more of a reliance or usage of our warehouse funding mechanisms into our fourth quarter. And as you see in the GMV guidance, we're showing pretty strong sequential GMV growth from Q3 to Q4. In fact, from a seasonality perspective, I think even faster than what we saw last year. And as we saw during our second quarter, when you have that kind of sequential growth in GMV or that acceleration quarter to quarter, it can sometimes push some of the economics for loans originating at the quarter and the subsequent quarters. And the reason why Q3's outperformance was so strong was in part because of both the volume and balance sheet strategies we had used in Q2. So volatile markets that we think we're going to be able to continue to navigate to fund and scale the business, but it will change the shape of the earning a little bit and what we saw in Q3 versus Q2, we kind of expect to see in Q1 of next year against Q4 this year.","Mike discusses the strong performance in revenue-less transaction costs in Q3, largely due to credit outperformance, and anticipates continued volatility in Q4.

The headline was really, hey, this is a really good product, better than credit cards. That said, there are concerns specifically around stacking and furnishing, which is a fancy term for reporting credit performance back to the credit reporting agencies. And CPB expressed strong desire to see the industry figure out a way to help folks build the credits and also have accurate reporting of performance of these loans. I'm actually quite proud to share that we at Affirm are partnering with FICO, which is the maker of pre-eminent scores out there. to build a first-of-its-kind credit scoring model that would enable buy-now-pay-later loans to be consistently transparently factored into credit and lending decisions and to be reported to the credit reporting agencies.

Could it move lower from here? And then maybe just remind us what drives the seasonally higher delinquencies in Q4 that you touched on in the shareholder letter.","Yeah. Really proud of the credit results in the business. And given the very short duration of our asset, the real-time performance of the portfolio derives the allowance calculation for a firm. So what we're not doing is making estimates of where the economy will be in a year and building balances for that. Because by the time we get there, of course, our asset turns over too fast. There'll be very little, if any, principal left on the balance sheet. or outstanding with even forward flow partners by the time you get there. And so we don't think about credit as a long-term estimate. Instead, we think about it as a more near-term reflection of the actual performance of the credit that we have out. And given our really strong delinquency performance, measured however you'd like, the allowance rate has continued to come down and we would expect that to be in line with historical patterns from here.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"I was wondering on the new pricing actions that rolled in a little bit late, what do you see there typically in terms of attrition or other impacts kind of downstream when you go about rolling those in? Is that a risk factor for later, or do you have a pretty good idea in terms of what to expect as you roll those pricing actions in over the course of the next few months?","We have seen zero attrition that I can think of. Michael will correct me. But it is not a matter of risk of implementation, but it is very much a matter of timing. process is a little bit more complicated than in some cases anyway than simply notifying someone because for a large percentage of our merchants they utilize something or anything in our set of offerings as far as buying down rates is concerned so the conversation isn't just hey we need to raise prices on consumers or you need to pay us for mdr it's inevitably a conversation about how the programs change what buy downs will look like going forward now that there's a different construct in front of the consumer. For example, you might see we now have a significantly more visible set of 4% and 5% APRs, not a product or not a program that we featured last year at all, et cetera. So it's a matter of underestimating complexity on our part. And the other unfortunate reality is that having these conversations in calendar Q4 with merchants is just not something that happens very quickly. So we don't have much risk in those conversations, but the timing made a little difference. And I think it's also important to know that from a consumer price standpoint, we continue to believe that there is very minimal elasticity.

That said, the subsidies to reduce the rates or eliminate them entirely come from both merchants and platforms as well as manufacturers, et cetera.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"The new guidance, especially in the second half of 23, points to lower volume and revenue growth and RLTC that's actually going to be down year over year. I know you stuck to the profitability target, but how are you thinking about the longer-term margin and profitability of the business? And how do you get there, given that the growth seems to be slowing before you've really hit escape velocity?","That's a great question. We continue to believe that the long-term range of the revenue-less transaction costs as a percentage of GMV should be in the 3% to 4% range. I think you have a couple of factors going on in Q2 with respect to the timing of how we earn the revenue and how we recognize the expense that distorts it, and given what we think is a one-time step up in loans that are held for investment through our warehouse financing growth, we think that obviously will weigh down the full year number, but still allow us to end up in the 3% to 4%. And the reason for that is, as we talked about before, the business is really a mix of split pay, paying for volume, which has margins that are much lower and very profitable, longer-term monthly installment, and the two mix in a way where we can pretty reliably predict that 3% to 4%. Additionally, I'd point out that we feel really good about the quality of the assets that we originated this quarter. That is to say the economic content there is really good.

So not sure that we would hold ourselves to the framework that we outlined a year and a half ago in this very moment. But I think part of the reason we laid out our profitability commitment to the end of the year was a reflection of the fact that we were wanting to get ahead of that from a framework standpoint. Just for the record, this is not the growth rate that I personally like. We intend to grow the business faster.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"I wanted to explore the long-term profitability question again.

And you just, you know, you obviously just did a very large reduction of force here. So my question is, you know, that, that seems to be helpful today, but to the extent that you're able to sustain long-term profitability, are you going to have to lean into something that requires a lot more automation on your part?

We have a lot of things that we want to build and we'll certainly expect ourselves to build it and deliver it. What we're doing right now is not building all those things concurrently. What we've really done is reduce the service area of engineering projects we're allowing ourselves to invest in, which a year and a half ago or two years ago was exactly the right strategy, and I stand by those decisions.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"If I could just do a quick follow-up on the pricing initiatives. The question here is really, as you increase APRs up to 36% as the cap, and then you're also, I guess, toying with the idea of increasing MDRs on the 0% APRs, which kind of puts a burden on merchants. I'm just wondering, do you kind of foresee any I guess diminishing returns associated with that from a merchant perspective. I know you have to get some approvals it sounds like in order for you to actually take those caps up, but I'm just wondering how those discussions have gone and what that kind of feels like from a merchant perspective.","I think everyone, merchants and a firm alike, are keen on more volume and as I've repeated often, I'll say it again, we are fundamentally governed by yield and risk management, so we must maintain the risk frameworks that we've signed up with our capital partners. If we are able to increase the compensation we get for taking the risk, and we really do think of it in terms of MDR, APR trade-off. There are many situations where the merchant is more than willing to pick up the increased cost because they want to pass the savings on to the consumer and attract them this way. That obviously works really well for folks with direct-to-consumer brands where maybe manufacturing is partially owned or fully owned. And in other situations where the brand is already paying us minimal possible and is unable to shoulder any more then it's the consumer that has to see increased rates. In either of those two cases, if we are able to raise the rates, we will increase approvals. This is fundamentally not about expanding a margin. We're quite comfortable with the margin structure that Michael outlined. We continue targeting those RLTC percentages, but being able to talk to our merchants about helping them sell","The question addresses concerns about potential negative impacts on merchants from increasing APRs and MDRs, while the answer emphasizes that both merchants and the firm seek higher volume and that merchants may accept increased costs to attract consumers.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"I want to talk first about this path to profits in 2023. Obviously, you reiterated that, but nevertheless, you know, you're looking for a little bit lower GMB and associated performance on the top line. How are you thinking about, like, the evolution of that timing and what you need to do to make sure you get to break even or profitability in 2023?","Hey, James. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we are still very much on time and on pace to achieve the profitability goal that we outlined, which just to recap for everybody, we talked about getting to profitability starting in the first day of our fiscal 24. We said on a sustainable basis, meaning that we'll tend to do it repeatedly most of the time, and looking at adjusted operating income. And so for us, the challenge is some pretty simple math. We need our revenue less transaction costs to be greater than the adjusted operating expenses that we have below the transaction cost line. The key things for us then are making sure we're doing everything we can to maximize the unit economics in the business. And if you look at our back half of the road map, we have a lot of focus on making sure we're doing all that we can and should do there as Max outlined in the letter. And we're gonna be mindful about controlling our operating expenses. And for that, that means being very careful in particular on hiring, but also making sure that we're not having any pockets of waste in the business. As we continue to scale the business and make the right investments, we also don't want to have dollars wasted in the system. If you look at our guidance in the back half of the year, the adjusted operating expenses that are implied by that, we feel like we put this in a really fit shape so that we'd be exiting right where we want to be to achieve that goal for next year.","The speaker confirms they are on track to achieve profitability by the start of fiscal 2024, emphasizing the need to maximize unit economics and control operating expenses.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Let's start with, starting with delinquencies. You know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that, you know, you're still a bit below where you were pre-pandemic. However, directionally, you're starting to get pretty close to those levels now. And just wondering how you're thinking about, like, managing that, especially since, you know, I would think that there would be an increasing number of repeat customers in that 2023 versus pre pandemic, which, um, if they're repeat, you would think that they would tend to be better behaving, um, in terms of at least delinquency, uh, et cetera. So, you know, where, where should we think that you would, that you'll try to top those out at how are you going to manage that? And, and, and what's the, uh, uh, I guess the prognosis for, for when you would do that and under what conditions.","I'll start, and I think Michael can probably help quantify the second half of the question. So just to set the stage, the most important thing to take away from us, we are not just managing credit outcomes. We set them. The whole point of these ultra-short-term, you know, 4.6 months, weighted average life of every loan, every transaction is underwritten. We have full control of transactions requiring down payment. or not. We control the amount, the down payment, et cetera, et cetera. So we have lots of levers we use to control risk. We've talked about this many, many times, but never gets old. And that gives us a lot of very nimble controls over the actual credit outcome. So we set a number we want to hit. Obviously, every week we get a stack full of new information going back to all the cohorts that are still active. And we adjust credit. And we have been now managing it quite actively to make sure that we get to the numbers that we require. Because the back book runs off very quickly, we have a lot of control. This compares us pretty favorably with the rest of the industry that does things like credit card consolidation loans or personal loans that go back years and there's nothing you can do about it. So that's just a really important thing to understand. And again, I apologize to those for whom this sounds like just an old repeat, but this really is how this business works. And the reason our numbers are as strong as they are today, you can see this in the letter, It's not an accident. It's not as though the world hasn't changed. There's plenty of stress to the consumer in the lower income brackets, lower credit quality. We're just good at managing, and we do underwrite every transaction, and therefore we have a lot of control. So that's sort of the backdrop. The counterpoint to this is the demand for BNPL is increasing. We survey our consumers. We see demand in the application side of things. Generally speaking, people are turning to, and not just BNPL, by the way. If you look at credit cards, people are turning to them more than they used to during the pandemic. People are not done in the higher income brackets spending through the pandemic stimulus, but they're getting closer, probably sometime mid-next year is when we'll see the exhaustion of those savings. But today, the lower income groups are already done, and they're starting to turn to various forms of debt. We believe pretty firmly we represent the best alternative out there. We have 85% repeat transaction from existing consumers to prove that. And so you have enough demand, and we do have a lot. We have enough diversity of merchants, whereas folks shift out of connected fitness and fancy homewares and go for big box, more quantity of purchases. We are there to help them with all those things. And so demand is still there. quite strong. If we have control as we do of our credit outcomes, we can manage to the number that we need and want. That's sort of how we're doing it. Michael can give you a little bit more data on exactly where we intend to run it. But again, this is a choice we have as opposed to a thing we have to contend with.  That's right. And it varies by product and it varies by merchant that we're at. And so I think your point is very well taken that we do see substantial improvements in credit quality as we see more repeat usage. And I'll note that we're still acquiring new users at a pretty good clip. And thinking about the business, we're still feeling it. We're not done with the acquisition side of the equation, certainly not on a gross basis. The additional disclosures that we've got now in the shareholder letter, we really encourage folks to spend some time with them both looking at the delinquency trends, which we now show 30, 60, and 90, as well as we've got the covertized net charge-off curve for our monthly loans, and then we've given you some trending that you can see on split pay. And I think the biggest takeaway for all of those is that we are dialing in where these things are. It's going to be a week or a month that varies up or down, but we get to dial in where those losses sit. And that's such an important strategic piece of this business. If we can pick that loss, then we can have confidence in how we think about the credit losses with respect to our capital partners. We can have confidence in how it affects our P&L. It allows us to confidently go approved to a very deep level. I think if you put us up against most of the people in the traditional financial institution world or most people who do unsecured consumer lending, our results are really good. We feel like that is a real strength for us, and we're not going to treat it lightly. That's something we're going to continue to do, first and foremost, as it's an important aspect in everything that we do.","The question addresses concerns about managing delinquencies as the company approaches pre-pandemic levels, particularly with an increase in repeat customers.

"Affirm Holdings, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"In the past couple of quarters, we've talked about the potential to change price to consumers. Does the fiscal 23 guide for revenue-less transaction costs assume any pricing changes? And if not, what would it take to get you to start that process?","Excellent question. So the short answer is there's a number of mitigants across merchant, consumer pricing, and the rest of our transaction cost line items that are not reflected in our guide. Those remain as upside. And a little bit, if you will, so how we think about the guidance. We want to be really careful to put in the guidance things that we are certain about as opposed to things that we hope will deliver and help close the gap.

It looks like it was maybe closer to 8% in 2024, if you strip that.","Ken, do you think? Yeah, sure. I'll lead into that one as well. So bear in mind, Grant, we had a pretty phenomenal year this year, right? Just to give you a sense, in Q4 alone, we had about a 40-40. If you look at our three-year and five-year investment performance results, we ranked in the roughly 40th percentile relative to the overall industry. AUM, as you know, has increased significantly. That's also driven up our EBITDA, and as a result, bonus payments. So I think the confluence of those factors compensation as well. The 3% year-over-year increase, I think certain bonus elements, right? So we do expect effectively a higher watermark, if you will, for bonus thresholds. So those levels of bonuses wouldn't necessarily be as high in the forecast year. And as a consequence, what you're seeing year over year is really just an increase in really more of the more normal sort of non-comp-based expenses that we would expect from inflation.

Thanks.","Yeah, hi, Tom. Yes, maybe I'll work backwards on your question there. Yes, the performance fees, we do reset it back for 2025. We don't reset for everything, right? So you can imagine for things like compensation related to higher AUM, we're expecting AUMs to stay at this level, if not increase, right? And so that's effectively something that... folks wouldn't get an adjustment for. We don't explicitly break out our SG&A for performance-based compensation relative to the other expenses. That just hasn't been our policy in the past. Yeah, Tom, it's Kevin. Let me add to that. So we know right now where managers are sitting in terms of their individual performance. Again, heavily tilted to a three-year number and a five-year number. So we can budget for that. What we don't know is if they do much better than that in the coming year and add on to that, but it should be marginal from there. And, again, if you think about it, we go back to a budget for this year. We reset everything. So we start from zero for the firm relative to its year, 2.4 this year, that 49% jump, we'd all be happy if we did that again. My guess is we're going to be pretty strong, but not that strong. So I think we have some comfort that that number was really outsized because of a bunch of factors.

And then I think the selling principles are also entitled to something like 10%. So we should think about 40% of the gross number flowing to Kensington, of which you own 51%.

We are starting to see that rotation, particularly into the fixed income, and I think what we're expecting to see is the VOC and the other... as rates continue to get cut going forward, we would expect to see it move from the money market, which, as you pointed out, hit a high of about $55 billion in assets under management, or I think it was a 25% year-over-year increase. So it really is going to be a flow from the money market into fixed income and then likely see it move into the equities, and we'll be prepared to be there for that.   Hey, Kat, if I can just add to that. If you think about the Bank of Canada cutting three more times from here, if that's what the market probabilities are, so you're at four and a quarter today, you're probably looking, therefore, at a GSE rate at the end of the year that probably touches three or even a high twos, and that'll start to even drag further on pulling money out. And I'd say the other offset is segments that we've talked about before, maybe in the mass affluent channel, which have been impacted by these much higher rates and mortgage refinancing, that relief probably starts to help them there as well. So you probably see the redemption rate on the industry start to come down as well. So it's a couple of things that will happen with those lower GFC rates.","The speaker confirms that a rotation from money market funds to fixed income is beginning, driven by anticipated interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2024,Financial Services,Just want to follow up on the performance fee of $3.6 million. Maybe this is for Ash. If you can provide a bit more color into this performance fee and what's your expectation for performance fee for the rest of the year?,"Sure. Happy to. Thanks for the question. So the performance fee was related to a monetization of a direct investment that sat within a co-investment vehicle that Kensington manages. So Kensington earns performance fees or carried interest off its various vehicles. The methodology for calculating them differs somewhat between the vehicles, but the common thread being they're always tied to monetization of underlying investments and the distribution of those gains to investors. Now, saying that, obviously performance fees and carried interest can vary given that they are heavily tied to the transaction market. And as I'm sure Most people on this call are aware we've been in a subdued private equity market in terms of transaction volume, largely as a result of the interest rate environment for the last 18 to 24 months. We are starting to see signs of that thawing, but I would not say that it's normalized quite yet. Maybe in line with some of the comments on the previous question, as we do start to see rates come down a little more and we saw the big cut in the U.S., We would hope that that would help increase the transaction market, which would then flow through to shops like Kensington being able to monetize more assets and drive some of that performance fee and carried interest calculations. I think we've said previously on a historical basis, we expect that to be somewhere between 5 and 10 at current size, obviously, as the firm scales. That will grow as well. The one last thing I would say is while we've been in a tough environment, The Kensington team has managed over that high rate timeframe to transact on eight or nine of their investments and generated across the pool of them pretty healthy multiples and returns. So I think that's a testament to the team over there and what we saw when we made that acquisition. Obviously, a lot of those transactions would predate our closing, but again, I think being able to transact in that environment in the private equity world is a testament to that skill set.","The $3.6 million performance fee is linked to a monetization of a direct investment managed by Kensington, which earns fees based on the performance of its investment vehicles. While the private equity market has been subdued due to interest rates, there are signs of improvement, and historically, performance fees are expected to be between 5% and 10% as the firm grows.",0,0,0,0,2,1,0.333333222,0.230769213,1,4,-0.59999988,0.035971223,24,6,0.59999998,0.215827337,1,0,0,5,0,0
AGF Management Limited,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"And maybe on a related note, just wondering on the M&A front, what are you seeing on the pipeline and perhaps your expectation going forward?","Yeah, so we continue. I think probably for the next few years, you'll hear me sort of open an answer to that question by saying we continue to canvas the market. We do have an active pipeline, and there are a number of opportunities that we've looked at in the last six months. The one thing I will say is we are refining our parameters of what is attractive to us as we move forward, and especially now that we have the first couple of deals under our belt. As an example, right now we are focused exclusively on the U.S., and that's largely to get a better breadth of opportunities that have a little more scale to them as we refine some of the parameters that we're looking at. That being said, and I think I mentioned this on a previous call post the Kensington and New Holland Capital transactions, these transactions do tend to have long deal cycles. We're generally dealing with the founders and partners of firms, and the time it takes to get to know each other, so to speak. So while we are active, we do expect deal cycles from sort of initial introduction to any potential closing to be anywhere from 8 to 14 months. So it does take us some time to actually get these done.","The company has an active M&A pipeline and is refining its criteria for potential deals, focusing on U.S. opportunities for better scalability.

Yeah, and one of the things we've talked about, and back to the next comments earlier, just to make sure you're all kind of, the industry is bottoming in here. So we're going to be seeing months of positive flow, months of negative flow. It's just kind of flattening around. But as rates come back down, as Judy said, we start to see that pick up. So I'm not surprised we're going to see some flat months and pick up months. But clearly, as we talked earlier in the year, this is probably when you start to see it come back.","The quarter to date is flat, indicating that the industry is stabilizing with fluctuations in positive and negative flows.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2024,Financial Services,I want to just go a little bit deeper into the revenue from long-term investments. I see that was up considerably recently. compared to the last quarter and the year before. Could you maybe provide some color onto what your outlook is on the fair value of some of those investments going forward?,"Hi, Renee. It's Ash here. Happy to take that question. So it was higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but we generally tend to think, and we've said this on this call before, that over the course of a year, we're expecting anywhere between the 8% and 10% return range on that pool of long-term investments. The current quarter sort of falls right smack dab in the upper end of that","The question inquires about the recent increase in revenue from long-term investments and seeks insight on their future fair value.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2024,Financial Services,Sounds like a good rebound in your fund performance side. Can you maybe provide a bit more color where you're seeing opportunities and how are you positioning your strategies? Or is it just really just lapsing the tougher kind of year-over-year number in Q1? And maybe elaborate on your thoughts on rate cuts and how you're positioning your funds that way.,"Yeah, thanks, Kerry. Good morning. Yeah, as we had talked previously, a couple of things going into this. One is you identified rolling off that patch from last spring of 2023 when we saw that real narrowness of the market. If you recall, this was the convergence of that Silicon Valley bank issue, which I think scared people into thinking this was the OA crisis again. At the same time, the AI phenomenon was emerging. And so you think about March, April, May, basically the only things working were a few Megacab names. Obviously, as you know, we have a pretty diversified mix of things that we do. So uncharacteristic quarter for us last year. We had a really strong April and May for us. So think on the complex things that are in the 30s kind of percentile, with, again, one being best. So as we lapped off those very difficult ones and put those on, that puts us right back, as we thought, to track. Going forward, I think the market is going to struggle with this idea of a lot or success of rate cuts. Until you actually see a series of them in the U.S., I think that's where you're going to finally see the broadening out. And we've been able to plow through that, again, in a difficult part of this first half of the year as well. Going forward, I think rate cuts do materialize. From a positioning standpoint, we have not changed much. We're pretty close to being neutral. In our balance portfolio, in terms of that mix of fixed income and equities, a little bit of cash, and we still have a pretty good hedge on in terms of market probabilities with kind of an anti-beta ETF in there. But net-net, I think performance is that, you know, we do a bunch of different things. Our growth mandates have hung in there well, despite this being a supercharged growth market. And across the board, again, we have a pretty good mix of things working for us right now. So it's not one thing in specific, I would say, Gary.","The fund's performance has rebounded, particularly after a challenging previous year, with opportunities arising from a diversified strategy and a strong April and May.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2024,Financial Services,How are you envisioning your flows in the back half of the year? Any updates from a quarter of the day standpoint?,"Well, I guess what I would say is that we are pretty confident with the strong performance around positioning our platform predominantly in the growth area. We've got strong performance across the U.S. growth and the global growth mandates as well, have very good performance on the fixed income. We think as investors start to move out of the HESAs and the money market funds, they'll be looking to come back into market. And I think our platform being diversified and well, good performing mandates that we're just positioned to capture. capture the flows. Kevin, did you want to add anything?   Yeah, I think, Gary, as we've talked about, we're in a period where flows in the industry are starting to flatten out and stabilize. We thought that that would look like this in the first two quarters. The first move out will be people, once you hear that rates or think that rates have stopped rising, you're going to move out of cash and go into the bond account or the fixed income world to pick up duration. So when they start to cut rates, you can see some, not just the coupon, but get that return kicker. And that's what we're seeing. If you look at flows, on the industry level, heavily out of balance funds right now, but positive on the fixed side. So while the industry looks negative, it's flattened out. To Judy's point, once you actually start, and going back to my prior comments, once you start to see rates being cut fairly aggressively, GIC rates will drop even faster. That will move money out and back into the industry. So our backdrop is really still what we said last quarter, kind of a late half story to see the industry turn. But quarter over quarter, with a seasonally obviously strong Q1 because of the retirement funding season RSPs, Q2 for us actually came in on a gross basis even stronger. So that's a pretty good indicator and a combination of, again, performance, but flow is probably picking up for the industry later in the year. But tracking kind of where we thought.","The response indicates confidence in strong platform performance and a positive outlook for future flows, particularly as investors shift from cash to fixed income as interest rates stabilize.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Just wanted to see what you're seeing in the M&A pipeline. Looking on the private side, now that you've got two under your belt, are you seeing more activity or are you kind of more focused on integrating the two that you've done, Kensington, New Holland Capital, first before reengaging in additional platforms here?","Thanks, Gary. So I'd say a few things on the pipeline. I think the activity in terms of closing those two transactions in the first part of this year has certainly caught some awareness out there, and part of our pipeline is now inbound-based as managers see the activity and are starting to see the vision that we see for AJF Capital Partners. But you are 100% correct on your latter point in that we do want to make sure we get off on the right foot with our partnerships with Kensington and New Holland, and so some of our time and resources is dedicated to that onboarding. I'd say the other factor is now that we do have those two deals on the books, we are being a little more precise or refined in terms of our target profile for future managers that we'd like to bring on board. That's both in terms of the obvious one sector, as we've now knocked a couple of sectors off the table with our current partners, but also a little bit in terms of geography and manager population in the U.S. versus Canada. as well as some of the evolution we've seen in certain sectors. As an example, you know, private credit in the U.S., where certain parts of private credit have become a little saturated, and we're conscious of that as we look at managers as well. The other one we're thinking about is, you know, real estate being at or maybe near bottom, and given the deal timeframes and our manager conversations, We might be in a pretty good time in 25 from a deployment perspective, and perhaps more importantly, we're in a much better place today in terms of being able to diligence those managers and their track records versus 12 months ago in real estate where it was still a little opaque as to what was going on. So maybe the quick summary is our pipeline is active, but we are balancing that with making sure that our existing partnerships, we pay enough attention to those, especially in these early days.","The M&A pipeline is currently active, with increased interest following recent transactions, but the focus remains on integrating existing partnerships with Kensington and New Holland Capital.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"I just wanted to drill into some of the accounting noise this quarter with the Kensington transaction. Just a few points I wanted a bit of clarification on. The $6.5 million of SG&A that was related to the long-term incentive program at Kensington, as I understand it, the value of Kensington's investments will be mark-to-market quarterly, and so there will be a corresponding fluctuation in the level of unrealized carried interest. Now, there's a portion of unrealized carry on investments that were made prior to the acquisition that would accrue to the team, the Kensington team. Is that the $6.5 million recorded in SG&A. Am I thinking about the interpretation of that correctly in the sense that it's really just some accounting noise that we should be looking through here?","Hey Nick, it's Ash. Maybe I'll just quickly start with some background on the program and then hand it over to Ken. But earlier this year, so as you can tell from looking at the financials, Kensington implemented a new compensation plan, and that included a long-term incentive component tied to the performance fees and carried interest that their funds generate. This is a pretty typical, as you may be aware, a pretty typical structure for compensation plans in the private equity or private capital world and aligns deal team members with achievement of performance. Typically, you would see firms pay out somewhere between the 40% and 60% of carried interest or performance fees through these long-term incentive plans to employees. If I were to say that another way, if there was $10 of performance fees generated in any given year, on average, $5 of that will be paid out through the long-term incentive bonus plan, and the balance of that being retained by the firm. Now, there's a little bit of a disconnect between what I just described, which I'll just call the actual cash occurrence in a given year versus the accounting treatment. So maybe I'll hand it to Ken to tackle that.   Yeah, thanks, Ash. Nick, you're right. From an accounting perspective, the cumulative amounts of the future LTIP payments are recognized up front before any of the fee revenues are actually earned. And given that this is a new plan, most of this expense is front-loaded, I would say, over the course of the next two years or so. As Ash had alluded to earlier, on a cash basis, though, you should recall that revenues will far exceed the actual LTIP expense that's actually paid.","The question seeks clarification on the $6.5 million SG&A related to Kensington's long-term incentive program, particularly regarding its accounting treatment and unrealized carried interest.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Can you give a bit more color and details on the $24.4 million revenue from the HES Capital Partners, maybe the chunkier pieces? And then historically, you've got it to that 8% to 10% return on your long-term investments. The question is, why is that so relevant? I think in your slide, you show kind of 12.3% IRR, and obviously, you've done better than that this quarter.","Yeah, thanks for the question. So maybe I'll start with the 24 million and a good chunk of that is the fair value increase. That fair value increase is largely, not entirely, but largely related to our infrastructure investments. And so I'll just make three very quick points more specific to that. So right off the bat, and as we've said in prior calls, Some of these fair value increases can be pretty lumpy in nature. As a result of underlying closed-ended fund business plans at the portfolio company level and J-curve impacts, we would expect, as we've seen in our historicals, that that lumpiness would continue. More specifically to our infrastructure investments, we started in this space in 2016. That's the vintage where a lot of our early dollars went in. So we're now looking seven to eight years ago. Generally, those investments are now on the other side of the J curve, again, from a business plan execution and value creation perspective. So it's not surprising to us that we're starting to see some of this value creation come through in the fair values. And lastly, I'd say that, again, it's not surprising for us to see business performance and metrics improving for infrastructure assets, especially those that fall into the more traditional definition of infrastructure. And by traditional, I mean businesses that have a pretty high component of real assets, inflation-linked revenue streams, and pretty high barriers to entry. And in our case, when you think about the revenue streams, we would expect that in the environment we've been in with inflation, that you would start to see this push through on the revenue impact. And that is indeed what we are seeing in some of the underlying investments. And so I think we're at that stage now where it is starting to get reflected in valuations. All that being said, we remain pretty comfortable that our fair values are reflective of the underlying investments given the sectors that it's coming from and what's going on both within that sector and on a macro basis.  Okay. Sorry, just on your second question around the returns, We think of the 8% to 10% and our invested capital in the space and what we can expect sort of averaged out, even though it's going to be lumpy from that perspective. Really, the 12.3% and mentioning that is for us to indicate that we are achieving growth. the returns that we would expect on these investments. And if you think about that from a net basis, and you think about the sectors we're in, and infrastructure and private credit for the most part, that is a pretty fair to good performance on a net basis after fees.","The $24.4 million revenue from HES Capital Partners primarily stems from fair value increases linked to infrastructure investments, which are now yielding returns as they move past the J-curve phase.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"How should we think about the Kensington contribution and performance fee expectation now that you've kind of closed that transaction. Can you provide kind of historical performance fees versus management fees mix? And then on a related question for New Holland, can I maybe just remind me how their contribution hits your financial? Is it just the interest from the convertible notes or any other nuance that we should be aware of?","Yeah, happy to answer that, Gary. And good morning. Yeah, firstly, maybe with respect to Kensington, we typically, you know, would not guide to revenues overall for each of the respective businesses. And as many are aware, in particular, performance fees can be quite lumpy quarter to quarter. Having said that, though, I mean, the SG&A guidance we did provide related for the most part to, you know, the consolidation of Kensington plus some additional investments that we are looking to make. for the broader capital partners business in general. And the expectation is that even factoring in the SG&A increase, that we would still be accreted from an EBITDA basis on a go-forward basis. With respect to your question on New Holland, this is very much just treated as an investment in our books. And so you're right, it is very much one where it generates investment income on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and as well as any fair value adjustments that we would have to make in light of current market environments.","The speaker addresses questions about the Kensington contribution and performance fee expectations, noting that performance fees can be inconsistent and that SG&A guidance relates to Kensington's consolidation and future investments, while still anticipating EBITDA growth.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"On the Kensington piece, are you able to provide maybe the historical performance fee mix versus management fees, like not on a prospective basis, but maybe historically how they've done?","I'll let Ash jump in as well, but I think as the results will flow through, you'll notice that the performance fees typically are quite lumpy and, in fact, potentially paid out even towards the end of the year. It's just quite challenging to forecast that out and provide a lot of guidance on it, but I'll ask Ash to provide any further color.   Yeah, I think part of what we see is over the last few years, if you think about 2020, 2021, and 2022, it is highly reflective of that lumpiness. And so in 2021, generally across the private equity industry, you would have seen very, very high levels of carried interest. 2020, you would have seen almost the exact opposite, and then it slowed down again in 2022 as rates went up and there was a little bit of a freeze in the capital markets from a transaction perspective. So it becomes difficult to think about it on a go-forward basis because it is heavily dependent on how the capital markets are behaving. So just to be clear, those performance fees are essentially like carried interest in that they are driven by underlying monetizations. which is sort of leading to both Ken and I's comments around the lumpiness.","The question inquires about the historical performance fee mix compared to management fees for Kensington, while the answer highlights the variability of performance fees, noting they are often unpredictable and influenced by market conditions, with significant fluctuations observed in recent years.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Maybe just update on the RRSP season, maybe talk about how you're positioned to capture the potential flows back to investment funds when rates eventually fall and GICs and cash kind of move back out of the sidelines.","Sure. Thanks, Gary. Well, just a quarter to date, I guess that would be from March 1 to today, we're seeing about, I'd call almost flat, of course, but minus 20 in redemptions. And so it's been an improving trend quarter over quarter since March, the last few quarters, which is encouraging to see. And then as we look to the market, you know, you've probably seen the same data that we've been looking at, which is quite a big shift of money flowing into actual fixed income mandates. You know, maybe GSEs are coming mature and et cetera, and they seem to be flowing more into the funds. And from that perspective, we feel quite comfortable. We've got a really good lineup of fixed income mandates. We expect we can be taking our share of that market. We have fixed income plus, which is a four-star morning star. F-Series and Global Convert and a couple of others. And maybe, Kevin, did you want to add anything else on the investment side?   Yeah, Gary, good morning. Yeah, you're starting to see anecdotally, if you look at just money market flows and HESA flows, the margin is starting to turn negative, which would lead me to believe that when we look at industry data in March, my guess is it should actually be the first non-RSP month in two years that we may see a slight positive flow for the industry. Not sure if it's a guess. What will happen is it'll come back, as Judy said, as GIC is mature. People will first go to bond funds because you're actually getting income now. And second, people are going to play for a rate cut, which means anything with duration is going to do well. And so my guess is you'll see it slowly start to seep out of some of that. I think the real big impact on flows, though, will happen when you start to seriously cut rates. The banks will drop GIC rates a lot faster. that will move money back into things. But I think at the margin you're starting to see it. But in terms of, you know, we outran this for I think seven of the eight quarters that the industry was negative. We knew we were going to eventually flip it over, which we didn't. And I think now you're seeing the other side. We should start to pick back up as the industry starts to get healthy.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2024,Financial Services,"I just wanted to circle back on the question around the fair value adjustment in the quarter. So the adjustment was $22 million. The long-term investments at the beginning of the quarter were about $250. So the magnitude is something like 9%. I don't know what the split is between infrastructure and private credit, but really simplistically, if it were split evenly, it would apply more like 19% or something in that order of magnitude in a single quarter. It just seems unusually large to me. Was there any event that triggered the revaluation of a chunkier investment or anything more specific that kind of prompted the markup there?","Thanks, Nick. Maybe I'll take that. So generally, we won't and aren't really in a position to comment on the underlying investments.

Maybe on the SG&A guidance itself, you know, we don't provide specific breakdowns on the components. I will tell you, though, that the increase from the roughly $205.6 million to $209 is going to primarily be driven by non-compensation related expenses.

I mean, as we talked about or as we presented, in fact, if you look at page 7 of the presentation, it does show how our overall performance was for 2023. And as we talked about, we had an adjusted retail mutual funds net redemption number of $41 million. But that was against an industry that saw, you know, huge outflows through 2023. And even if you look at the Q3 to Q4 number, Redemptions did get worsened within the industry by 73%, but we actually saw ours only decrease by 28%. So we're seeing that our particular numbers, when we look at our net redemption rate, we are, as against AUM, it's half of what the industry is. We're seeing its growth flows are up 8.5% between Q3, Q4, relative to industry being flat on growth. I think what this is, it's a redemption story. And as we see the year progress, we do see continued hardship with that group of investors who need that cash and access to the cash.

If there's a number you have on what the Q124 to date retail net sales are and just kind of thoughts, it sounds like maybe a bit more muted, but just outlook for RSP season for this year?","Yeah, I mean, I think for sure Q1 2024 months to date is minus 70 million fiscal year to date, which starts December 1 is negative 131. Again, we're still seeing some strong growth flows. And so I think this really continues to be a redemption story, which again, given the continued high interest rate environment and inflation environment, We probably do anticipate that that will continue for RSP season, but RSP season is traditionally a much stronger season for us.

AGF Management Limited,Q4 2023,Financial Services,"Yeah, Jeff, let me follow on with what you said. You can see if you look at it, it's not been a gross issue for us, right? Even the industry was sort of flat quarter to quarter. RSP season really won't kick in, I think, until really next week or so. My guess is with the deceleration in the net side, and if you look at from November improving, you know, November was tough on the industry. The quarter was tough. But December, I think the industry was out six-ish kind of billion. So it's a pretty good improvement. So I would expect that the RSPCs on the growth side could be okay. And the net side may even have a shot of breaking even. But I think until you really see, as we've talked on the previous call, some relief on rates from the Bank of Canada, which looks like it's later in the spring, maybe early summer, that's probably really when you're going to see a sustained return to the industry flow.","[No explicit question here, but the answer is a continuation of the previous answer, so not a new Q&A pair.]","The discussion highlights that the industry has not faced significant issues recently, with expectations for improvement in the RSP season and potential stabilization in net growth, contingent on future rate relief from the Bank of Canada.

AGF Management Limited,Q4 2023,Financial Services,"Yeah, so my first one is on the fair value and other income for 4Q. It was a tad light versus the other quarters. So is this just the lumpiness? And should we still model the, I think, 8% to 10% on return of your long-term investment looking out?","Hi, Chi. Yeah, I can answer that question. Yes, Q4... I would say overall the earnings from private capital was a bit lower. While we still had an overall positive fair value adjustment, we have sort of pointed to sort of the lumpiness in these fair value adjustments. One thing I would highlight, though, however, is if you kind of look on a full year basis, our overall private capital earnings have increased, right? And that's an increase both from private capital managers and on the private capital side. So to more specifically answer your question, if you kind of look at our overall private capital LP returns for the year, that's been about $25 million in 2022 and about $26.6 million in 2023. And if you just take that as a percentage of our overall invested capital of about $215 million or so, you'll note that the return profile is north of the 8% to 10% returns that we've guided. We have, as we've looked at internal models, seen the internal rate of return since its inception on a pre-tax basis closer to around 11, 11.5% or so.

So what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to hold expand lines?","Sure, yeah, I can take that as well, Chi. As I mentioned earlier to Jeff, most of that increase is really driven by what we expect to be an increase in cost and really non-compensation related expenses, things like sales and marketing as we continue to invest in growth. From a headcount and, I guess, compensation perspective, we're generally going to be keeping that flat year over year.

You can't just annualize that number and split it, take that number and split it into four. So just when you think about that model, Q1 tends to be just a little bit higher.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2023,Financial Services,"Maybe for Kevin or Judy, maybe if you can elaborate kind of what you're seeing from the retail investors. Last three months, industry retention has been quite significant. I think you mentioned $19 billion. How are advisors, clients dealing with the higher cost of living, higher interest rates, et cetera? Maybe talk about that. how that might impact your flows outlook for the balance of the year.","Sure. Thanks, Gary. You know, obviously we're seeing a continuing challenging market environment that I think everybody's waiting patiently for a rate cut to stimulate some more investor movement back into equities. At this point, though, we're seeing some soft redemptions for the month of September, about minus 29 months to date. And we just expect the investors, you know, they're sitting on the sidelines in HESAs and money markets in GICs. And as we expect, you know, hopefully that the rates will get cut. I think it's been taking a little longer for that to happen. But when that does happen, we do expect certainly our equity suite will be in a position to receive those funds.   Did you want to add anything, Kevin, on the market?   Yeah, you know, Garrett, you know, our growth sales are not the issue. Our growth sales are actually important. tracking to where we thought it is a redemption issue for the industry. The redemption rate in the industry has ticked up, and a lot of it is factors Judy had mentioned, but also there is some hardship out there. We're seeing people leave funds going into bank deposits to actually pay bills, people leaving registered accounts to pay mortgages. So until we get to a rate cut environment where you can take the pressure off some of the end investors, I think the industry is going to have a bit of headwinds. Now, the good news is we're closer to the end of the cycle, with rates being hiked. So we're probably looking at not too far in the distance for rate cuts. But the challenges for the industry are really going to see an uptick in redemptions for everybody for a number of those reasons. But, again, you know, ours is not a gross issue. It's really this uptick that the industry is seeing just on that hardship line, as I call it.","Retail investors are currently facing challenges due to high living costs and interest rates, leading to increased redemptions and a preference for safer investments like bank deposits.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2023,Financial Services,"Kevin, while I have you, portfolio positioning, I've seen the markets be a bit softer the last couple months. How are you positioning your funds, looking at your call-on rate and maybe cash levels within your funds versus historical?","Yeah, so we're getting closer to, again, the end of the tightening cycle, which would push you toward a more neutral stance on things. Obviously, the backup in interest rates in this recent period is actually probably a place where investors will start to add back to duration. So bond funds probably... still come back, I think. But you're seeing, obviously, from the investor side of it, Gary, people getting whipsawed again, negative returns in bonds for that last quarter. People are probably doing the wrong thing here. You should be probably buying into these bond funds up at these levels because you're getting pretty good coupons here. So our positioning is obviously more neutral in the portfolios. From a performance standpoint, you know, we had a, as we'd expect, when the market narrowed in that first quarter the way it did when basically, you know, 10 names drove the entire market. And just a reminder, but I know you guys follow up closely, but the S&P is up maybe 11% year-to-date. The equal weighted S&P as of this morning was actually negative. So the damage for us was really in that first quarter because we would not participate in that kind of a narrowness. Since that point, you know, our performance has been fine, and that is positioning on our balance suite of being, again, closer to the equity weight. closer to fixed income, still keeping a hedge in that portfolio with an anti-beta product and a little bit of cash. So as you expect to get to the end of the hiking cycle, you'd expect us to try to get to square up those bets and be more neutral.","Kevin indicates that as the tightening cycle nears its end, his funds are adopting a more neutral stance, suggesting that investors should consider buying into bond funds due to attractive coupon rates despite recent negative returns.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2023,Financial Services,"The 8% to 10% return on your long-term investments, you mentioned tracking at the higher end of that. I guess first, should we look to model at the higher end looking out? And then second, You've included that in your slide, I think it's slide 12, where you showed the implied multiple excluding these investments. How else can you look to service value here?","Yeah, sure. Let me talk to the first question first, Gary. You know, we still feel pretty good about our guidance in terms of an overall private capital business revenues of ranging between $5 million to $7 million, sort of the low end of the $5 million being sort of one from private capital managers and four from the PLP funds. And then on the high end, you know, two on the private capital managers and around five on the LP funds. I'm feeling pretty good about that, given where our positioning is and where investments have been. Bear in mind, however, though, that, as I said, I mean, the private capital LP funds do move and fluctuate, right? And so as I look at the valuation, I mean, another way of looking at things is to look at the sum of the parts and say, hey, look, I mean, the LP funds in themselves are fair valued at $250 million already, right? And so... you could take the consideration that we could remove those earnings and apply a proper multiple to the remainder of the business and sum it up that way. So I would just take that as another viewpoint for you as well.   And then can you repeat the second question?   Yeah, no, just on your new slide that you had showing the investments and what the implied value is on the rest of the business, You know, are there other ways that you can help to service value, I guess, more so on the bottom part, whereas trading, I think, two and a half times even?   Yeah, I mean, I think the first point we wanted to highlight was simply the fact that if you look at the rest of the industry right now, that average trading multiple is more like 7x, right? And so clearly, if you look from an apples-to-apples perspective, this two and a half times is pretty discounted, especially considering the fact that we have demonstrated really strong resilience, right? I mean, again, as Judith alluded to, we've had some pretty strong results in spite of sort of, you know, the substantial underperformance in the industries from a net redemption perspective. Plus the fact that, you know, I mean, look, I mean, you know, we haven't talked about the third leg of our business, which is that private capital business. And, you know, our hope is that through time, we will be able to bolster EBITDA from that private capital business, which you know, if you look at the industry as a whole, it does attract a higher level of multiples. And so there's multiple ways for us to see valuation increase here, both in terms of the base business, in terms of just getting to par with respect to industry multiples there, and then sort of adding on additional private capital EBITDA as we sort of look to, you know, potential strategic opportunities.","The speaker expresses confidence in maintaining revenue guidance for their private capital business while acknowledging fluctuations in private capital LP funds.

AGF Management Limited,Q3 2023,Financial Services,"I just wanted to go back to just your discussion on the retail net sales and just wondering, Kevin, Do you have a view whether or not it's just seeing the start of rate cuts, or do you think there needs to be a certain level of how much rates come down to see what's called a material improvement in industry net sales? I'm just wondering because to the comments of there's people struggling day to day, expenses, mortgage, debt payments, deleveraging, all that other stuff. Will lower rates really help, or are there just other investors that have lots of cash on the sidelines that'd be willing to put it to work when rates are lower. Just trying to understand the size of those two camps or at least your sense of it of the people that low rates may not necessarily help them want to invest versus those that probably have access cash and willing to put it to work at the right time.","Yeah, great question, Jeff. So the way I look at it is as follows. If you think about the last six quarters in the industry, the outflow has been $100 billion. That is the worst six-quarter period we've looked at, I think, in 20 years. The fact that we've gotten through this with 11 straight quarters is the first time we've taken some pain. It's been a pretty resilient story. I think to your question, though, It's going to be a couple of things. When you cut rates, some of that $100 billion, which is parked in cash, some of it is in cash. We know it. We see it in ESAs out there. We see it in GICs. The equity market will start to move. And bond, as I've said, the bond market, you'll get really good returns out of fixed income potentially as you cut rates. You'll bring a bunch of that money back in. That will maybe, I think, not maybe, I think is going to offset the some of the pain until you get rates low enough for the hardship investor. There's going to be a time a year from now, if we're in, again, a softness in the economies here in the U.S., Europe, and Canada, central banks will start to get more aggressive about cutting rates.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2023,Financial Services,"Just want to go back to the $16 billion in net outflows for the industry. It's fairly sizable. Maybe for Kevin or Judy, can you share with us kind of what you're hearing from the retail clients, advisors, their rotation into GICs, elevated inflation eating in the savings rate, and maybe give us a glimpse of how kind of fund flows are tracking in the first few weeks of June?","Yeah, hey Gary, it's Kevin. Let me start in all hands to Judy for some additional current color. I mean, I think, you know, if you look at last year, we had equity markets down, we had fixed income markets, three negative quarters of that. And at the same time, people finally getting alternatives to move into GICs and others, right? So I think of that, if you look at the trailing 12 months, you're really looking at a number that's probably 70 billion out of the industry. And I think it's all three of those, right? You had investors spooked, you had higher rates, and people sitting on the side. You're seeing the last quarter, it's starting to moderate. I would caution until rates start to come down, people are probably going to hide out in GICs for a bit. But I think that the trend towards stabilizing, if the equity market kind of continues to grind along here, you could probably see a pretty decent start to next year, but it's hard to predict right now. But I'd say most of the money, you know, the rate of flow is starting to dampen, which is a good thing for the industry. You know, when it comes back is a jump ball, but it's going to be, again, as rates start to drop, people feel like they don't want to leave it and GIC is repricing lower and stabilization markets may bring people back. But there's a fair amount of hardship out there, too. I think people are dealing with higher costs, higher mortgages. Some of that may be actually being used to fund lifestyles and bills. But Judy, maybe you can give some more color on the current quarter start.   Yeah, thank you. I guess we're also hearing across the advisor base, too, that there is some money in motion if their current provider did not perform as well last year. So we were able, I think, to take a bit of advantage of that. What we're seeing, as you know, we did report the 11th net positive quarter. We're seeing... going into the month to date June as we know is seasonally slower and we do expect that to continue through the summer but we still remain at basically flat slightly negative And I think what we're anticipating is that, you know, the summer should be a bit softer, but the later months of the year should be stronger again. And that's a trend, Gary, we've seen every June. It's one of those things where, you know, you kind of scratch your head and say, why June? But, you know, you can explain July and August, but the industry tends to soften up in June a little bit. And we're not seeing a different pattern, though, than we've seen previously.","The discussion highlights a significant $16 billion in net outflows from the investment industry, attributed to factors like market volatility, rising interest rates, and a shift towards Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs).

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2023,Financial Services,"My next question, just on the SG&A guidance bump, what are you assuming there in terms of maybe Q3, Q4 net sales, and how much does that move the needle if it goes above or below kind of what your assumptions are?","Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things going on here. One, you got to remember, we took out probably 20 million right before COVID, the years coming right into COVID. So we basically positioned, you know, to pivot the strategy a bit and move toward more growth, right? So that was part one. Two, I'd say when you look at the current environment last year, we looked at how to shift our channel strategy away from, again, and to defend when DSC was going to leave, how we'd pick up in other places, right? And that was obviously, as you've seen, DSC has rolled off our sales and stayed resilient. We incented parts of our channel strategy at a different rate, and they're actually doing what we want, which is diversifying away. So that's cost is something we look at sales for the rest of the year. We've kind of baked that incremental comp from that sales twist in there. So gross is running literally where we thought, if you will, from where we were a year ago. It's just a different mix, which is something we had engineered and wanted to have happen. The second component of it is really on the investment performance side. And we can talk about it later, but short term, we've had a drift in it because of some of the issues going on in the market. Our comp plans are heavily tilted toward longer investment performance, which is what we want. We want to be more heavily tilted toward three and five versus any one. So the strong performance from late last year is feeding into those higher calculations. So that's probably the second component of that guidance change. And I'd say the third is basically there is just higher inflation everywhere, and I think we're all seeing it. We're fully back to work here. So we are traveling at a normalized rate, which is significantly different than we were last year. But the spend rate for hotels, airlines, et cetera, is double-digit kind of inflation. Our data costs from providers for indices and other things also running at double-digit rates. So we factored that into it as well. So we feel pretty comfortable when you put those three that we have good line of sight on sales, good line of sight on performance, and we've made some assumptions around this higher inflation, which is stickier.","The question inquires about the assumptions behind SG&A guidance and its impact on net sales for Q3 and Q4.

AGF Management Limited,Q2 2023,Financial Services,"Just on the private old space, 16.3 million in that fair value contribution this quarter, maybe give us a bit more color. What is that related to specifically kind of what funds or what assets can, I think you said it was higher valuation as well as a game, I believe. Was that right? and how do you get comfortable with the private marks on these assets in today's environment?","Yeah, sure. I mean, yes, we did have a $16 million bump up from their value adjustment. I'd say about two-thirds of that was just from valuations of our various funds. A third of that was actually driven by some monetizations that we had achieved. So I'd say overall, I mean, we are tracking from a evaluation perspective and just seeing some results across the board from our respective funds and in terms of the marks how do you get how do you guys um kind of get comfortable with with the valuation yeah so the um on the monetization is pretty clear right there's just yeah an asset that uh we sold and carry um the other piece of it is i call it quote unquote event related with the underlying funds meaning there is some Transaction activity would surface new marks on things, which gives you pretty good clarity. And two, I'd say related to that, the assets that we're playing with in those spaces or infrastructure where we're not seeing any issues in the industry with missed marks, the assets that underlie infrastructure are pretty visible and clear. Second, private credit, same thing. Not typically where you're seeing people have issues. Where you're seeing people in the industry have issues is real estate right now. Hard to value if you're in commercial real estate what that is. We don't have that exposure. Or if you're in buyout funds or what I call late stage growth equity.

So Judy can maybe give you some color on the SMA. So we don't lump the SMAs into that number. So that's a separate number.   Yeah, and just in terms of the SMAs, looking specifically, I guess, to our U.S. institutional strategy down there, we've been seeing some strong flows after about only really two years with that strategy in play. We're now on about four or five different significant platforms, and we're now growing that business to approximately $500.5 billion, which really represents about a 70% growth year over year from last year. And so we're really pleased with the trend on that. It's about $50 million a quarter. And then also, you also commented on Canada. Canada is not in that 77. We keep that bucket separate, too.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Kevin, can you talk about the increase in seed capital to $224 million in this quarter versus $200 million at Q4? What strategy was that put into, and are there any other imminent capital calls? And then just on the fair value adjustment as well, it was a little bit light versus last year. It sounds like you're still expecting that 8% to 10% return on seed capital over the long term. or are there something else that's running through that line this year, just keeping the marks on those assets in a higher rate environment?","Yeah, thanks, Gary. Let me take that in order. Yeah, we did have two investments that were made on two calls that were capital calls, two different strategies, one on a new partnership with First Ascent Ventures, and then one of our capital calls on one of our infrastructure funds. So that was the reason you saw the increase in the alternative line. In terms of the marks, Q1 is always a little lumpy because we weighed upon some of our GPs to get their audited financials in. And so, as we've always said, this is a line on that will be lumpy from time to time. We still think $4 million to $5 million per quarter is kind of an average way to think of it for the year. So, think of it as $20 million per year through that one.","Kevin discussed the increase in seed capital to $224 million due to investments in a new partnership with First Ascent Ventures and an infrastructure fund.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Just moving on to the higher SG&A this quarter. I know Q1 can be a bit lumpy. And Kevin, you mentioned several items that could move that SG&A line, including investment performance, HEF share price, et cetera. So what gives you confidence right now? I know it's still early in the year that you'll hit that $202 million full-year guidance.","A couple of things. One is it's early in the year. Two, obviously, the two big drivers that we can't control, obviously, are investment performance, which if it remains strong and continues to accelerate, that will have a variable. It could have a variable the other way if it softens a bit, too. At the same time, we are running probably the industry-leading sales right now, so if that continues to pace while we budget for it, if it comes in higher than that, that will have a But those are the two we can't control. I would say the rest of it right now looks to be tracking. So that's why I say we're okay with the guidance of rapid. And Jenny, you have any thoughts on it? No, just to say in the quarter, in the first quarter, too, there was some seasonality. So you can't take that 202 and just divide it by four, which I know you're aware of, Gary.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Maybe just last one, I'm not sure if Judy's on the line, but are you able to quantify the net flow so far in March? And then as well, maybe for Kevin, in terms of the retail side, gross sales, where are you seeing clients funneling cash into? And given the noise over the past few weeks, have you seen clients kind of sit on the sidelines a little bit more?","Yeah, thanks, Gary. I mean, I'm going to take this opportunity to emphasize we did hit our 10th consecutive quarter of net positive sales. And as you pointed out, In your report, net sales of 221 for the quarter, that is really one of a handful of firms on a net positive basis for the quarter. And we're really, as Kevin said, really proud of the team and how they're performing in that regard. When we look as well, I think it's also notable when you look at the RSC season, January was really soft. February came back, obviously. But the industry just for the season was down about 90%, and we were down about 35%. So again, we continue to outperform, which is something that we're proud of, but we're very much tracking. So month to date for the month of March, we remain in positive flows of about 45 million, and we're seeing that across all positive flows across all client segments as well. So again, pretty strong right now. We're feeling fairly optimistic, but I mean, you can talk about the markets, Kevin. Yeah, Garrett, I'd echo what Judy said. I mean, it's a tough environment out there, and I think we continue to manage through it really well. The fact that all of our channels are in positive flow tells you it's not one area that we're seeing it. It's everywhere, which is the health of the business, if you will. In terms of investor sentiment, I was out. I saw probably a large number of advisors on multiple meetings out west last week. There is some nervousness about the market right now. Having said that, there's also a lot of cash that's come out and sitting on the side that's waiting to go back. So I think to the extent that last week's event around the banking sector in the U.S. maybe has pulled forward the idea of a recession. That means this market can move forward sooner. I think that sets up wealth or return to some of those flows later in the year. Obviously, if we were to be in a contracted period, which we don't see, some type of greater financial contagion where the banking sector weakened much further and was sustained that way, that would change the view, but that's not what we're seeing today. In terms of product area, I think you asked product as well. Where is this coming from? It's pretty broad-based. It's not one thing. It's really a pretty good breadth of things.","In March, the company reported a net positive flow of approximately $45 million, marking their 10th consecutive quarter of positive sales despite a challenging industry environment.

AGF Management Limited,Q1 2023,Financial Services,"As you mentioned, obviously, share price, performance, and sales are a bit out of control and can influence your guidance. But maybe ask it in different ways. If the share price were to have stayed where it had closed yesterday, performance that you saw in Q1 stays the same through the rest of the year. And the net sales, when you just for the seasonality you have in Q1, but when you just for the bid, you kind of maintain the momentum through the end of the year. Presumably, that would have the SGA be higher than the 202. Is that a fair way to look at it? And if so, do you have even a ballpark of how much that would move things up?","Yeah, I'll take that, Jeff, to going backwards on the share price first. We've hedged a large chunk of that exposure. That's probably 20% of our shares or our share-based compensation, which is not hedged. which we're going to try to cover off some point this year. So that won't have a lot more variability from here. It was the sharp jump on that unhedged piece from what we ended last quarter of something in the sixes to the nines, right? That was a big material impact. So, you know, that I think is something you should not see repeated. In terms of the investment performance, if it continues to accelerate, there could be some variability there. The same with the sales. If they're tracking to what we just saw, then I think we're okay. But again, it's too soon to tell. But you're thinking about it the right way. If they're pacing right where they are, we should be roughly where we think it is on the 202. If they accelerate, obviously that would be a variable that goes against that.

So let's start with Thames water and we'll take it from there. So obviously let's start with our, you know, the UK water sector is an essential service obviously and those water utilities are monopolies in their service areas. So that's a good fact to start. The UK government has stated that they really don't plan to nationalize the water utilities. And frankly, they don't really seem to have the room in their budget to do so. And they would like to see additional investment. So I think the macroeconomic background for the UK water sector looks pretty good.

So again, it's an area that we feel pretty good about. they've made progress in their recent, in the final regulatory determination recently.

Number two, rates are adequate to pay debt service, but not to provide for capex additional capital improvement. So it's a capital issue, not a operating issue.

So looking at it a different way, If it was say 1112 versus eight to nine five years ago, and what another way of saying is once you rate size, the capital, you could be earning $10 plus per share. Yeah, probably, probably in that range. But again, you have to write, I think you got to separate two things you got to separate out. the amount of business being written and the amount of business being earned, right? So it does take a while for the business to come in. And the ROE, what I'd say is I think if we right-sized our capital, we'd probably be a low double-digit return company, right? So that would make sense. And then you've got to look at how much business you're writing to achieve that low double-digit return to know exactly what your dollars per share earning is going to come out of that. It's really important. I have a question for all of you. Remember, we're writing business in today's current market, which means today's current interest rates and today's current credit spread. Those things do change. So there's favorable markets in some cases and less favorable markets in other cases. And therefore, you've got to remember, it's only one year's contribution. Our earned premium is made up of 20 years of contribution of different rates, different returns, et cetera. So it's a mix of business. But you're looking at the current market yields of today's business, which doesn't mean necessarily it's the same market you're going to see through the rest of 2020. And it's also important to note that in public finance, we're still capturing like on average, like 60% to 70% of that spread savings. So you're still providing significant value. And the other lines of business, structural finance, and international infrastructure are less sensitive to changes in credit spreads.","The question inquires about the potential return on equity (ROE) based on an increase in average premiums, suggesting a hypothetical ROE of 11-12%.

And what is your outlook for 2025 muni issuance? Do you think you can increase your insured penetration further?","Well, insured penetration has been increasing basically year to year. The value of the insurance is getting better recognized, and you can see that in a lot of ways. Large deals we've been on this year, penetration in the AA market, and the overall penetration as well. So we expect that to continue as bond insurance continues to be a really value in the marketplace, allows for execution. In the spread environment that we're in, there's still savings to be made for the issuer. And obviously, the ease of execution makes it a real opportunity for the issuer to benefit from. We expect issuance to remain high. There's a crying need of infrastructure investment across the country as well as internationally. So our volumes, we continue to expect to grow as well. I want to add on the large transactions that we completed over the last year. We're capturing a significant portion of that spread.

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"NBA announced last week that they would consider putting themselves up for sale after prep or clarity in Q1. I believe this is the third time, but my counting is kind of difficult, that they've put themselves up for sale. In my opinion, there's only one likely bidder, and that's you, and it's just about price. And so I guess my question is, MBA has got to be looking at how well your stock done and how well your capital management has been.

So I guess with that preamble, my question is, Is there a possible way to consider a contingency payment based on the outcome of PREPA?

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"I was hoping you could get into more detail on the water deals. I understand that relative to the exposure, the economic provision this quarter was de minimis. Can you get into what these water utilities actually do, what revenues support the bonds, and what protections are in there against an ultimate loss?","Sure. Sure. So, you know, Jeff, these are obviously essential services. You're providing water for the UK water sector. And let's be clear, these are monopoly services. There's not a competition going on for the water. But, you know, there's a certain need of investment that exists right now that has to be supported and that, you know, they need to access the capital markets. The UK government has been clear they're not looking to nationalize the water utilities. So you really can't push down the bondholders too badly because you really need to access the capital markets to do that work. And let's talk about our exposure specifically. Our exposure is the senior debt at the operating company. So we're not at the holding company level where I think there may be some infirmities and there is debt below us in the operating companies. Also, as you know, all our exposures P&I when due. And we do not have any principal payments on any of our exposures to 2037. So we have plenty of time on our hands to work this out and let the markets work it out. And we know there's a number of groups in the market right now who are looking to supply some short-term funding to help them through to get to be able to raise more equity to support that sector. And obviously, we're very supportive of both new equity and new debt being raised as long as it doesn't significantly impair our position. I think you're right in the assertion that we didn't put up a big loss this quarter. We don't see this as something that's particularly bothersome. I think it's just the natural order of how things have played out, and we're happy to sit there and support this, but it's not something that we're looking at and saying, wow, this is going to be a problem from a capital basis, from a reserve basis. I think there's just a natural order, and we expect relatively insignificant, if any, losses from this. And remember, Jeff, they rely on the capital markets to fund the entire operations. There's a significant amount of debt across the board on all the regulated utilities. They're highly regulated. They're required to maintain investment grade ratings. We're in a senior position. We expect no real issue here except for working out the short-term difficulties they're having in terms of cash flow. Let me just add, you know, As required under the accounting model, when something goes below investment grade, we have to probably wait all scenarios. So while we might not expect a loss, but we're required under GAAP to put all those scenarios in.","The question seeks details on water utility deals, including their functions, revenue sources, and loss protections.

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"What is causing the, it sounds like a cash shortfall for these utilities?","I think what's happened over the years is they've pulled money out. The equity owners have pulled money out, and they haven't reinvested the money right now in the water sector. So you can read the headlines, and you'll see some articles that suggest that there are definitely infirmities in the system, and there need improvements, just like every piece of infrastructure in probably a lot of the countries around the world. And I think that's what's driving the need to raise new equity to make the improvements going forward so the people in the U.K. can have clean drinking water. I think it's a capex problem, not an operating problem, but the capex problems got to be solved so that they continue to provide the services that are required to do by the regulatory bodies, which are now saying in areas like sewer waste treatment, you need to make a significant improvements, which requires capital. So we've got to raise the capital. I think the other thing we're waiting on, obviously, there was a rate determination early in the year. That rate determination is being appealed. So we're waiting to see what the result of the appeal is. And my guess is if they don't get a successful resolution, they'll appeal again. But I think that's really what's sitting out there. There is a need to increase the rate slightly to help support the capital X improvements that need to be done for the water sector.","The cash shortfall for utilities is primarily due to equity owners withdrawing funds without reinvesting in the water sector, leading to a need for new capital to address infrastructure improvements.

There is a CMA process to go ahead, and if they don't like the result, as I mentioned, they can appeal again. Historically, that's been a relatively decent process for the water utilities.

I guess we were a little bit surprised not to see a more favorable mark once that ruling came through.","Well, I'll give you the top and I'll let Ben give you the bottom. So at the top, the ruling is very favorable and obviously it's a ruling that we had expected all along as the judge continued to avoid the law, ignore the contract that was signed.

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Switching over to as capital, kind of stick with me here where I walk through some numbers.

I know it's modest development we saw this quarter on an economic basis, What are the pressures there? And more importantly, what are your protections in those deals?","Let me start from the top. So remember, when we look at healthcare, we always look at essential services, major leaders in the marketplace, and provide ourselves with other covenants to protect our position. Obviously, coming through COVID, that caused a tremendous spike in pricing, both nursing and supplies, you know, labor costs went through the roof, other costs went through the roof. And I think it's been a while. for both the third-party reimbursement to adjust as well as the hospitals themselves to adjust. As we've seen in our book of business, things continue to improve. As I said, we've got tremendous covenants and protections. So we're still very optimistic about the value of healthcare. And we only get paid when problems exist. So we're happy to make sure that the, you know, opportunities we see in the market are realized. We typically have mortgages on the properties. We have liquidity constraints. We've got debt service reserves and covenants. We've got debt service or debt service coverage covenant. So, as I said, it's a well-protected portfolio. Obviously, the stress has been caused mostly by COVID and inflation, but we see the hospitals now starting to address that. The results are improving, and as I said, the protections are pretty strong. We still like the business. We get paid when there's problems in the market, so it's a great opportunity for us to increase overall production as well as the return of those individual policies.","The healthcare sector is facing pressures primarily due to COVID-related spikes in labor and supply costs, which have not yet fully adjusted in reimbursement rates.

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"The other question I have, I'm not sure you can answer it, but obviously the company's ROE is diluted with all the excess capital that you're sitting on. Can you give a range as to what the underlying operating ROE looks like if you were running at efficiency?","No, we have a target that we've got to get to double digital in every business that we write relative to the overall business written by each of the profit centers that structure international and domestic public finance. So that's still the goal. What's killing us is obviously the excess capital that we carry, which has principally been in response to the problems in the past, you know, the Great Recession, the pandemic, Puerto Rico. As those things now dissolve and basically dissipate, Biggest argument we're having in the company is how much of a cushion we want to keep on the excess capital and then take the rest of the capital down to that level. But as you know, with the statutory limitations that we have, it's going to take some years to get there. But we have a plan to get there over the near term. We're confident both in the growth in the business, the further diversification through things like asset management, we'll be able to achieve an increase in the R. As I said, the E is coming down based on the schedule that we established in terms of capital management. Maybe not coming down as fast as we'd like. If I told you what the excess capital was, it's basically the same as it was back in 2013 when we started to buy back. Now we've bought back $5.2 billion, I think, of stock. We're still back to the same spot of excess capital, which is probably a good problem and a bad problem, but it does affect the ROE. We're still working to make sure that we can make a meaningful dent into that excess capital.   And Jeff, as Dominic said, as we expand internationally in structural finance and international infrastructure, those ROEs are mid-teens or even higher.

Obviously, we've had a lot of movement on rates and spreads, but can you give either qualitatively or quantitatively how the market has changed over the past two years with respect to penetration rates, pricing terms, conditions? I mean, net-net, it seems like it all should be positive, but obviously it gets distorted from what we see with mixed change and all that stuff. So I'm wondering if you could just dig a little bit more into that.","Oh, Jeff, I would say it's all positive except for one thing, which is issuance. So let's talk about it. So number one, interest rates are higher. That's a real benefit to our business across the board. So it's what we can charge for premium versus in addition to how many people would seek insurance now, try to save some financing costs. The issuance has been is A, the municipalities have been awash with cash from the relief that they got through the pandemic. So they had to run out of their checkbooks, which has taken quite a long time. So we didn't have any need to finance. And then 2, because of the volatility in the marketplace and the interest rate environment, people are a little concerned that there's always a prediction that rates are going to come back down. So whether I should wait to finance in 6 months or 9 months, because I get a better rate. So, I think we've got conditions that support the growth of the business and support the insurance industry through the interest rate process. Like I said, they haven't had a need to borrow, but we know in the municipality world, it's not a matter of if it's only a matter of when and the winds coming. And because of the higher rates, we think we're in great shape to make significant production gains across the board. Spreads, of course, in a volatile market tend to be a little bit volatile.

Assured Guaranty Ltd.,Q2 2023,Financial Services,"You would request special dividends from any company with excess capital. How do you think about true excess capital now that the business is growing again, and the fact that you're being held to a triple A capital standard as a double A company? I have to imagine that that 1.8 billion buffer is not necessarily all excess and I want to say we go back 20 years ago triple A companies might have retained 5-800 million cushion. Is that the right way to think of what is true excess capital across the companies, or is there a different framework to consider?","Remember, we've got a lot of regulators in our business, so not only do you look at S&P, but you also have to look at the states, have to look at the other agencies. But I think the excess capital position of the S&P number is a fairly good number, and growth by and large itself will not significantly impact that. You remember, as we write business, we get the benefit of the on our premium reserve as part of the capital calculation. So the business is not that dilutive to capital excess. And I think we'd lose about maybe 12 to 20% of the PVP would be of the business written in terms of additional capital. So it's not a big number. So to get excess capital, like I said, you have to go through all the measurements by all the entities. There are different hurdles that you have to meet. There are different buckets that get counted. So we look at all companies and go through the entire process of evaluating those criteria to see what excess capital, you know, we have and therefore what can be divvied out to help us do the capital management program that we've been implementing. And that'll be part of the discussion with the regulator. So, you know, we start with, Jeff, with the 1.8. We want to keep a cushion of a number based upon what we believe is appropriate. And, you know, in years past, the number would have been higher because of the volatility of Puerto Rico. And now maybe we can lower that buffer as such. But you never want to be in a situation where you actually, you know, you jeopardize ever, you know, a downgrade can put you in a situation where you drop below that AAA level.

We will continue to evaluate what's the best course of action to take, and if we see the opportunity to accelerate, we can still meet all the requirements that we have relative to the regulation and rating agency will do that.

This year, we undertook a thorough review of the uncertainty provision, which was set above the loss picks from our actuarial reviews and refined our analysis, including its allocation among our lines of business. The uncertainty provision did not reflect any emergence, and we have maintained the overall estimate. However, we have decided to reduce the provision in excess workers' comp and reapportion approximately 150 million of the provision within excess casualty. We elected to move this portion of the reserve to excess casualty as the development factors and the length of the tail can drive a wider range of outcomes on our reserves. To be clear, our traditional reserve methods are not indicating any emergence in excess casualty, but we felt, given the nature of the provision, it was more appropriate to be situated within this line. As a reminder, our reserving philosophy is to react to bad news quickly and wait to recognize good news over time as we monitor developments.","In 2022, a provisional reserve was created to address inflation, primarily affecting workers' compensation reserves.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,Can you provide more detail on the accounting treatment and financial statement impacts of the Corbridge deconsolidation this quarter?,"On May 16th, we announced the agreement with Nippon Life. Because that sale could close within 12 months of the announcement and reduce our ownership to well below 50%, held for sale accounting and the classification of Corbridge as discontinued operations was triggered for accounting purposes. Next, we sold 30 million shares of Corbridge on May 30th, which brought our ownership to 48%. However, it did not trigger deconsolidation accounting because AIG still had a right to majority representation on the Corbridge board. On June 9th, we raised our right to majority representation and one of our designees resigned from the Corbridge board triggering deconsolidation accounting as well as the required filing of pro forma financials with the SEC four days later. Discontinued operations and deconsolidation accounting principles drove significant changes in AIG's financials this quarter. We added a few slides in the investor deck to explain these changes, which I will refer to in my remarks. Let me start with the impact of held for sale and discontinued operations on slide 15. Held for sale accounting stipulates that when you reach an agreement to sell a business, its financials must be recast in the current period with assets and liabilities each classified in one line for both sides of the balance sheet. However, since Corbridge was a core business that we fully intend to exit, it also met the accounting criteria for discontinued operations, which requires a recast not just for the current reporting period but also for past periods. As a result, we reclassed Corbridge's assets, liabilities, and net income into assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations net of income tax in the AIG financials for the second quarter and prior periods. This treatment is reflected on slide 15. While AIG total assets of $544 billion as of March 31, 2024 is the same as originally and following discontinued operations presentation, there is a significant movement within the line items. For example, total investments in cash of $324 billion as originally reported decreased to $88 billion with discontinued operations presentation with $236 billion of Corbridge investments in cash now included in assets of discontinued operations. The next change in the quarter was deconsolidation, which was triggered on June 9. On the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call, I described the accounting steps related to this principle. Today, I'll walk through those steps with the final numbers. Turning to slide 16, the first step is the fair valuing of Corbridge's assets and liabilities as of June 9. The net fair value amount was $9.7 billion comprised principally of the $8.6 billion market value of our Corbridge shares at that date and the net fair value of intercompany assets and previously consolidated investment entities. Next we calculate the difference between the fair value of $9.7 billion and the book value on AIG's balance sheet, which was $6.7 billion. This resulted in a net gain on sale of Corbridge of $3.0 billion pre-tax or $2.5 billion after tax. After that, accounting principles require the recognition of $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss on AIG's balance sheet, which is unrealized losses on Corbridge's investment portfolio due to higher interest rates. This recognition records a $7.2 billion loss from AOCI in AIG retained earnings by booking it through the loss and discontinued operations in the income statement and then reducing AIG's AOCI on the balance sheet. This does not change shareholders' equity shown on slide 17. To determine the income statement accounting impact of deconsolidation, the $2.5 billion after tax gain and the $7.2 billion of accumulated other comprehensive loss are added together to calculate the net after tax loss on deconsolidation of $4.7 billion. Finally, the next step is to add Corbridge's net income for the quarter prior to June 9th, which was $325 million after tax to the net loss on sale, resulting in a total net loss on discontinued operations of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter. Now, I'll cover the impact on AIG's shareholders' equity, turning to slide 17, which has a walk of AIG's total equity from the end of March to the end of June. AIG's shareholders' equity was $43.4 billion at March 31, including Corbridge on a consolidated basis. Excluding deconsolidation impacts, the second quarter change in AIG's shareholders' equity was a decrease of $1.5 billion, reflecting income from continuing operations of $475 million, offset by $1.7 billion of share repurchases and $261 million of dividends paid. This results in a pro forma AIG's shareholders' equity of $41.9 billion before deconsolidation. Then, you layer in the deconsolidation impacts by adding the $2.5 billion after tax gain on sale for total AIG's shareholders' equity of $44.4 billion at June 30, 2024, for a $1.1 billion net increase in the quarter, resulting in book value per share of $68.40 at June 30, a 6% increase from March 31. Please note as well that $5.7 billion of non-controlling interest in total equity, which represents the portion of Corbridge equity owned by other shareholders, is also eliminated with deconsolidation through the recognition in the net book value calculation of the gain on sale. The last deconsolidation impact is on debt and leverage on slide 18. Total debt for AIG and Corbridge at March 31, 2024, was $19.2 billion and total equity was $49.1 billion for debt to total capital ratio of 28.1%. With deconsolidation, Corbridge's debt of $9.4 billion and non-controlling interest of $5.7 billion are eliminated on AIG's balance sheet. This results in June 30 balances of $9.8 billion for total debt and $54.3 billion for total capital for a debt to total capital ratio of 18.1%, well within our 15 to 20% target leverage range. We hope this explanation and the slides are helpful in understanding the accounting treatment of Corbridge deconsolidation this quarter.","The deconsolidation of Corbridge was triggered by a sale agreement with Nippon Life and changes in board representation, leading to significant accounting adjustments, including the classification of Corbridge as discontinued operations. This resulted in a net loss of $4.4 billion recorded in AIG's income statement for the quarter and an increase in shareholders' equity to $44.4 billion by June 30, 2024, alongside a reduction in the debt-to-total capital ratio.",0,0,0,0,2,0,0.9999995,0.19999998,1,21,-0.909090868,0.051282051,81,32,0.433628315,0.263403263,0,0,0,3,0,4
"American International Group, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,Can you provide more detail on the impact of the reinsurance decisions in the first quarter on net premiums written and how this positions AIG for future growth?,"Our reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. The strategy has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle. We believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients while also delivering improved risk-adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG, especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from CoreBridge. Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. This deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results. As a result of our divestiture of Validus RE, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and created meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns. Without going through each return period by peril and region, our key zone PMLs on average have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming.","AIG's reinsurance decisions in the first quarter impacted net premiums written and strategically positioned the company for future growth by enhancing underwriting profitability and diversifying its business portfolio.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,Can you elaborate on the changes made in January 2024 regarding the allocation of catastrophe costs and how this affects your competitive positioning?,"In January of 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus REIT. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio. It's worth noting when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post-deconsolidation and subject to market conditions. As a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group, with a 1 in 11 attachment point in North America wind and a 1 in 19 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure. Importantly, our net premiums written in commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio. Our earnings potential is significant, and when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025.","In January 2024, changes were made to the allocation of catastrophe costs to better reflect pricing and enhance growth opportunities, resulting in a competitive advantage with the lowest attachment point among peers.

Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corbidge sell-downs and market conditions. All of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter, depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future core bridge sale proceeds, general insurance dividends, and market conditions.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Can you provide more detail on the reserve review process for 2024, particularly regarding the North America Casualty Book and how you are addressing industry trends in adverse casualty loss development?","At AIG, we perform detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience. We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty Book, including excess and primary casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation, and mass tort, comprising about $20 billion of reserves, or 44% of our total reserves. In the third quarter, we will review international commercial lines, global financial lines, commercial property, and other lines totaling about $22 billion, or 47% of reserves, with a balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter. Between DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends, and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review, or AVE, for each book. The AVE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR. Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges, or significant major events. We are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development and trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the re-underwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book, and by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American casualty 2016 through 2019 accident years by over $1 billion. We also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain excess casualty segments to 10%, and by 2022, all excess casualty segments were at or above 10%. Our AVE reviews on North American casualties since the second quarter 2023 DVR continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today, and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility.","AIG conducts annual detailed valuation reviews (DVRs) of its reserves, with the North America Casualty Book scheduled for review in Q2 2024, focusing on trends and loss development.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q4 2023,Financial Services,Can you provide more detail on AIG's January 1 reinsurance renewals and how the company evaluated risk-adjusted pricing changes in the current market?,"When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023. Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceeded a billion dollars of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past seven years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last seven years, there's been nearly one trillion of aggregate losses, with over driven by secondary perils. The headline is that we were able to significantly improve our property cap structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus RE, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million, and our core property treaties excluding Validus RE have slightly lower seated premium year over year. Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the modeled attachment point is lower and the exhaust limit is higher. Our international property cap per occurrence structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million. We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan, decreasing, the modeled probability of attaching our cap reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023. Our property cap aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone sublimit dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio. Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible, and Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductible of $20 million, other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million. Our return period attachment point is lower year over year. For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintained our seating commission levels, reflecting our market leading, underwriting expertise and position in the market. Turning to casualty, the challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic and litigation funding in the US were a focal point for reinsurers at 1-1. For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of re-underwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today. Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have lost trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past two years, given inflationary dynamics. I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in four of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been six years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent five calendar years. Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our casualty lines excluding workers' compensation averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and 17, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense. We significantly strengthened the reserves by over a billion dollars for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017, and an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability and commercial auto, using the most recent schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures. Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting 2018 that provides us with substantial amount of vertical protection. Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retained lines with no impact on seating commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintain their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improve reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams.","AIG experienced a successful January 1 reinsurance renewal, improving its property catastrophe structure and coverage while reducing overall spending by approximately $200 million.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q4 2023,Financial Services,Can you provide an illustrative pro forma view of AIG's capital structure and adjusted shareholders equity post-deconsolidation of CoreBridge?,"With AIG's current ownership of core bridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, core bridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of non-controlling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on pages 8 and 11. When we deconsolidate, we will report core bridges as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and core bridge shares included in parent investments. Core bridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials. If we were able to deconsolidate core bridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current gap carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities. The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders equity. For simplicity, in this example, we use core bridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value, but the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates. As a very high level illustration, as of year end, the fair value of core bridges net assets and liabilities was about two billion dollars higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost three dollars a share. However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about four billion dollars or around six dollars per AIG share, giving core bridges stock price relative to its adjusted book value. Now, let me link these items to the AIG year end pro forma estimate that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders equity of approximately 33 billion dollars, adjusted for the sale of Aladis Rea to be used in evaluating the ROCE target. At December 31st, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders equity was approximately 53 billion dollars. With the pro forma fair value decrease of four billion dollars at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders equity would be roughly 49 billion dollars, including about eight billion dollars of value for our core bridge shares. To get to the E, we subtract the value of core bridge shares. And for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year in parent liquidity of almost eight billion dollars, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management interest and other parent expenses, as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders equity of about 33 billion dollars invested in our business, plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10% plus target. This example is illustrative based on year end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful.","The question inquires about AIG's capital structure and adjusted shareholders equity following the potential deconsolidation of CoreBridge. The answer explains that deconsolidation would change how CoreBridge is reported on AIG's financials, resulting in an estimated decrease of about $4 billion in adjusted shareholders equity, leading to a pro forma adjusted shareholders equity of approximately $49 billion, factoring in CoreBridge's value and parent liquidity.",0,0,0,0,5,0,0.9999998,0.357142832,2,4,-0.333333278,0.027272727,62,14,0.631578939,0.345454544,0,0,0,8,1,2
"American International Group, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,"Can you provide more detail on the headwinds in North America commercial net premiums written, specifically regarding the non-renewal of Lexington programs and the decline in financial lines?","In 2022, we made the underwriting decision to non-renew two large Lexington programs. We took this action because we believed that these programs had meaningful cat exposure in peak zones, and we did not believe the appropriate cat loads were reflected in the pricing. These programs were not the best deployment of capital in order to achieve our targeted risk-adjusted returns. Those non-renewals tempered overall growth in Lexington. Lexington programs net premiums written reduced by 57% in the quarter. We believe over time we will replace this business on an individual risk basis as stronger risk adjusted returns. However, it is a headwind in the quarter. The impact of the net premiums written associated with these two programs was approximately $115 million in the third quarter. Also offsetting growth in North America was financial lines, which declined 11%. Accounting for approximately 20% of North America commercial lines net premiums written in the quarter. In North America financial lines, large account public D&O remains competitive as a result of excess capacity driven by new entrants to the market. Our renewal retention in our primary business remains strong, but retentions in our excess business were more challenged. New business and our excess book was down year over year as we were very disciplined in the current environment. Rate reductions remain most prevalent on excess layers, particularly the higher excess layer vertical towers where it's more commoditized and the most pressure exists on pricing. In primary, where we are one of the few market leaders, rates remain flat to slightly down. We remain confident in our approach to financial lines. We have a global business with scale focused on underwriting profit over top-line growth, which is reflected in the results this quarter.","The North America commercial net premiums written faced challenges due to the non-renewal of two large Lexington programs, resulting in a 57% decline in premiums from Lexington and a $115 million impact in Q3.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,"How is AIG managing its casualty liability and excess casualty portfolio in light of increased social inflation, mass torts, and litigation funding in the United States?","Over the past couple of years, I've spoken extensively about our portfolio remediation strategy, including where AIG has reduced gross limits since 2018 by $1.4 trillion. We have established strong underwriting guidelines and strong partnerships with reinsurers to manage both frequency and severity. We have followed a similar strategy with our casualty portfolio with more of a focus on severity. When we began the underwriting turnaround in AIG in 2017, we found that the prior strategy in casualty was similar to that in the property business, which was to write large limits with a gross and net risk appetite much greater than what we offer today. As I've outlined before, it was not uncommon to put out significant limits on any individual risk in excess of $100 million net on an occurrence basis. As we developed an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting, it required a change to our underwriting strategy. Today, our global casualty portfolio represents 12% of our total gross premiums written and 13% of our net premiums written. The North America segment represents 55%, and the international segment represents 45% of that number. And since North America has been the topic of discussion, I will focus on what we have done in that portfolio. In North America casualty, our gross limit for our excess casualty portfolio, including lead umbrella, has decreased by over 50% since 2018. Our average limit size has also reduced by over 50%. Average lead attachment points, which protect us from frequency and lower severity losses, have more than doubled since 2018. In terms of gross pricing, primary auto and primary general liability rates have increased approximately 200% since 2018, and excess casualty rates have increased by over 250%, remaining well above lost cost trends. In addition to the significant investment in underwriting excellence and talent, we built and executed on a strategic reinsurance program to further mitigate our net exposure and volatility. What once was 100 million net exposure for AIG is now a maximum net on any one claim of $15 million in international and $11.5 million in North America. And in our excess of loss treaties, we have reinstatement limits that exhaust based on extensive modeling done at the 1 in 1,000 return period. This adequately protects AIG from vertical exposure with significant limit available in the event there are multiple losses. Notably, the period prior to 2016 is covered by an adverse development cover for US long tail commercial lines. We purchased 80% of a 25 billion, excess of 25 billion on payments made on or after January 1st, 2016 for business written prior to 2016. The $25 billion retention was exceeded during the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently have $9 billion of the total unused recoverable limit left, or $7.2 billion at the 80% level. Conflicting views have emerged in the market on the combination of gross portfolio underwriting with the strategic use of reinsurance. There have been comments, particularly recently, that the use of reinsurance is not required if you're comfortable with the gross portfolio. We disagree. and simply don't support that as a viable strategy for AIG. We prefer to balance our approach and have developed a strong underwriting culture, which we have dramatically improved over the last five years, executing on the fundamentals of discipline and consistent underwriting, being very focused on preempting the evolving changes in the market, and using reinsurance strategically to mitigate unpredictable outcomes. Building long-term strategic relationships with our reinsurance partners for all of our reinsurance needs has been key to repositioning AIG. Insurers cannot reverse social and economic inflation. However, we are in control of how we predict and respond to the impact of these changes to the forward-looking landscape, including how we manage our underwriting through coverage provided, limits deployed, attachment points, and pricing. Our business is not immune from social inflation, but we anticipated it early and we took action. The consequence is that we're very pleased with our existing portfolio and we're well positioned to be able to prudently take advantage of opportunities that exist in the current marketplace.","AIG is managing its casualty liability and excess casualty portfolio by significantly reducing gross limits and implementing strict underwriting guidelines in response to increased social inflation and litigation risks.

"American International Group, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,Can you provide more detail on general insurance prior-year reserve development and the impact of recent detailed valuation reviews?,"In the quarter, general insurance prior-year development net of reinsurance totaled $139 million favorable, including $41 million from the amortization of deferred gain on the adverse development cover, about $129 million including the ADC gain, resulted from the detailed valuation reviews, or DVRs, with the balance from other items, like catastrophes. The DVRs covered $34.1 billion of lost reserves on a pre-ADC basis, about 70% of the total. The DVRs of particular note this quarter were for international casualty and financial lines, North America financial lines, and North America workers' compensation, which last year was completed in the second quarter. In total, North America had $154 million of favorable development, including $39 million from the ADC. International was $15 million unfavorable. Consistent with our prior comments, casualty, bodily injury, securities class actions, and medical workers' comp trends have been and continue to be more favorable than our reserving assumptions.

Second, the lag in earned premium growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2023 dissipated, and we saw 36% growth in earned premium in the second quarter. And we expect that earned premium growth will continue to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. The additional earned premium will provide operating leverage, which will reduce our GOE ratio in the third and fourth quarter. AIG has stranded costs from the transition of PCG to an MGA, and we expect to eliminate these costs over the next 18 months. Fourth, we expect the accident-year loss ratio for a high and ultra-high net worth business will improve with the combination of improved pricing in our admitted business and more business migrating to the non-admitted market, which already had a very positive impact on PCG's accident and policy-year loss ratios in prior quarters.

Focusing on Lexington for a moment, I would like to highlight a few achievements from the first quarter. The business continues to drive excellent performance, impressive growth, and has consistently improved its portfolio quarter after quarter over the last couple of years. Lexington's tremendous growth has been achieved through its relevance in the marketplace and increasing its market share, not from increasing limits deployed.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Just wanted to hit on the office loan that got downgraded in the quarter. Obviously, reappraisal volatility has been an issue overall, but maybe thought some of these Class A buildings, particularly in areas like Montgomery County, were a bit more insulated from that risk. Does this situation change at all, how you're thinking about that sort of risk as you look across the portfolio outside what's in D.C.'s Central Business District, and especially as we move through the year and get closer to some of these larger loans with 2026 maturities?","Yeah, I think we are and have been focused on all office, whether suburban or central business district. The severity of the decline in raised values is much more in the central business district and is ameliorated to a certain extent in the suburbs. That said, Different appraisers have different perspectives on appropriate cap rates, leasing rates, discount rates. For me personally, I was surprised to see a discount rate of 11% in a Class A suburban market with increased leasing activity. On the other hand, can see that overall the time to stabilization has been reduced to the current leasing activity. You're looking at this particular property as a stabilized value of about $110 million. So that's in 2027. So I think you're going to see changes as the pace of leasing increases or decreases in this particular class of building. I have cautious optimism that we are going to be in a position to continue. If you took a look at, there's one other similar property that you may have thought of that's an office property of similar size. that is also in Montgomery County, and that is on our top 25 list that we provided in our deck. That's number two on that list. And that particular property was appraised in February of 2023, compared to the May of 2022 appraisal on the property that we just placed into non-performing status. There was a 44% drop in valuation on the appraisal from May 22 until January of 2025. If you kind of extrapolated from there, and this would just be a ballpark swag, and took 44% decline in appraised value on the office property that comes up for reappraisal in 2026, you'd be looking at a potential $3 million charge up. So I don't think it's a staggering number. You may have different discounts that you're looking at and you may feel that different cap rates apply and that's a matter of judgment. But I think we're on top of these and continuing to work with borrowers. One of the things that really helped us on the property that became non-performing was the fact that we had been sweeping cash flow for a significant period of time and that assisted us both in the collateral valuation and and also in the ability to continue forward and fund any TI work that is necessary in connection with value-add leasing. I know there is TI work in progress right now on a particular new lease. I have cautious optimism on that front.

Those are bigger properties, and at the time, I think, GSA lease was thought to be as good as you could get on leasing.

I don't think it's a huge surprise that this administration would want to privatize that activity. So I would expect they would be trying to sell some properties, some in this area, some across the country.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Just start on credit here, and I appreciate all the added disclosure in the deck. I wanted to see if you could detail just a little further to pick up the non-performers, specifically the assisted living area. I know some of the migration there, you know, we've discussed before. So, I guess just what you're seeing in that area looking forward with payment defaults being more of a driver with these credits.","Yeah, Justin, I think I can give you a quick run through on where we are with the current non-performers. We have the one CBD office property that we had discussed in the last two quarters. That's about $28 million. We have an assisted living facility in Charles County, Maryland. That's $19.2 million. You have office in Arlington at $19.1 million, office in Northern Virginia at $18.5 million. Then the newer loans added this quarter. An assisted living facility in Montgomery County, Maryland, very well-located new facility. It had been current and performing at June 30th. I believe... There are some issues with achieving stabilization at this property, and the sponsor, I think, is looking at some kind of a negotiation in terms of a lesser payment, a cram down, really. That remains to be seen, but we've already marked the property down based on the current appraisal and added an additional reserve for that. I would say the ground lease land in Fairfax in Tyson's Corner is actually a great piece of property. But again, the sponsors are looking for some reduction in the amount owed on that. Very unlikely to happen. That's a property that should be readily saleable at a number significantly in excess of our carrying amount. The final one at $10.5 million is land that's at the end of the Dulles Metro. It is zoned for multifamily. It's with a ground lease. There are various issues amongst the fee owner, the adjoining landowner. And the ground leaseholder that is resulting in litigation, don't know how long it'll take for that to be resolved. If and when, we'll have a better idea. Right now there's an injunction against the property, so we have moved it into non-performing status. It is protected by a loan to value, but that's an evolving situation. Does that answer your question?","The question inquires about the status of non-performing loans, particularly in the assisted living sector, and their potential for payment defaults.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"And then, you know, I guess just on office, you know, more broadly, it was nice to see some stability there. Just as we look ahead to 25, you know, a lighter year for maturities before we get to 26, you know, just curious any commentary or early work you're doing in those buckets in terms of, you know, what you're seeing with appraisals and then just what you're seeing with occupancy rates.","There is still a lot of volatility in the appraisal area. I think it's because they're all driven by hindsight and you're looking at what properties sold for in the last year. Most of what you're going to find is distressed sales or foreclosures and those are what I believe to be the lowest possible values they could be using for calculating valuation on newer properties. When I look at what's been foreclosed on in our market, and I think this is probably true across the country, the large loans in the central business district are the ones that are seeing the biggest drop in valuation. There's a very limited number of buyers for those properties. very limited financing for anyone who is a buyer on those properties. We're starting to see some green shoots of activity in the market, but I think that the volatility in appraisals, while it should be improving, will take a while to shake out there. We are seeing very stable occupancy in the properties that we have that are going out the next 18 months in terms of lease roll or maturities. I think we haven't really seen degradation in terms of the suburban office market in terms of occupancy levels. We're actually seeing some activity out there. We really only have minimal in terms of life sciences projects, which I know have been having issues lately, but we haven't skipped a beat in terms of the office portfolio as a whole. I think one of the reasons is the proximity on the life sciences side to Fort Detrick and NIH that the 270 corridor has. So there really hasn't been weaknesses that we've experienced. I think The four loans that we have in the central business district, one's a trophy property. That's our largest loan. It's about $48 million. That loan is long-term leased to a New York-based international law firm. Not expecting a blip on that one. The build-out is almost finished on it, and they should be moving in shortly, and rent payments will commence. lot of confidence in that property. The trophy market is extremely tight. No change in pricing on that either. I'm cautious, but I'm optimistic that with a couple of more drops in interest rate, we should start to see some decent valuations done on these properties as we start to see market trades happen.","The discussion highlights ongoing volatility in property appraisals, primarily due to reliance on past distressed sales, particularly in central business districts.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"If I look at slide 26, that shows your top 25 loans, which I think is really cool to see. One thing that you talk about in your slide deck, and you've mentioned before that the biggest thing that's bringing some of your properties to NPL is not necessarily payment default, but it's a maturity and then the need to get an updated appraisal. And so if I look at that slide, it looks like the really only kind of your largest loans, kind of two credits that we might be worried about into next quarter. One's the, the office loan. That's about 85 million that matures in December. And then, The data center loan that matures in December, both are criticized. Any, I know it's preliminary and that'll happen in the fourth quarter, but any kind of preliminary thoughts on those two as we kind of think about the migration that we could see next quarter?","Okay, thanks, Catherine. Yeah, we do have those, not a ton of maturities coming up in the next quarter, six months or so. One of them is, you're correct, one of the larger office properties located in Montgomery County in Bethesda. I'm not expecting there to be an issue on that appraisal because the occupancy is good, the debt service coverage is good. We've swept all of the cash flow for the last year, year and a half. So that we've built up about $7 million in a reserve for build-out for new tenants if there is rollover there. And then also a payment reserve of about $2.5 million. So we think we're in good shape for that, even if they were to lose a tenant or two. Bethesda Market is doing pretty well right now for these Class A properties. They're not hugely worried. Tyson's, the data center that you're talking about, I am a little concerned about that one because while negotiations are ongoing with Amazon, it's tough to predict what Amazon is going to do right now in terms of data centers.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"And then maybe turning over to the margin, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen on deposit costs so far this quarter? I mean, your deposit costs have been so high, and so I would think that you would have a pretty high beta rate. on the way down. And so just curious what you've seen so far with the first 50 basis points of cuts and what you would expect from a beta over the next couple of quarters.","Yeah, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, we reduced non-maturity deposits collectively, or cumulatively, I should say, 65 basis points. And late in the third quarter, 15 basis points in August and another 50 basis points in September, haven't seen any preliminary customer behavior that would be concerning. There's been some statement cycles, which to me, or at least my history, that's important. That's when the customer oftentimes realizes that rates are falling on their account, but we don't anticipate any issue or concerns there.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"If I look at the slide that shows, I think it's the 254 million in maturities coming in the back half of the year. Jane, do you have just roughly how much of that is already on classified or criticized? And maybe, is some of that risk already kind of in those numbers? Or is there a risk that we could see more inflection or more downgrades, you know, as those lows mature?","There are some of those loans, maybe 60% that are already criticized or classified. We have taken a hard look at all of our maturities that are coming through. A significant amount of that are short-term extensions that we made when we initially put a modification in place for that borrower. For example, the large loss that we took in the first quarter on that central business district property was extended for a year, so it will be looked at again at the end of this year. We also have a loan that we placed in non-performing status in the fourth quarter of last year that's an office property. that we took a write-down on. Those particular properties and really all of our non-performing real estate book have current appraisals. They would be within less than a year. So we feel we've already absorbed the loss that would come from that area. It's always possible that there could be further deterioration or some kind of valuation risk associated with the appraisal on those properties, but I'm hopeful that based on the consistency I'm starting to see in appraisals, still some volatility. A lot of it is down to the individual property, but the discount rates seem to be coming a little bit closer together, and while there's still volatility in cap rates, The discount rate seems to be what's really been moving valuations in the last three or four months.

I think the biggest driver that we've seen on charge-offs have not been performance-related issues. They've been appraisal valuation-related issues. That does seem to be tempering a bit. I do think there are a few more market-based transactions as opposed to liquidation transactions, which are showing remarkably disparate valuations in terms of where they are. So the more that we see of market trades, although they are below what they were in 2022, 2021, right now I'm not seeing any enormous shift in that.

We need to have an appraisal within one year for any of the loans that you're seeing that are non-performing. And so we would update that appraisal on an annual basis. The updates of those appraisal that have been coming in recently particularly in suburban markets, have not been as severe with respect to discount rates and cap rates as what we had seen on Central Business District earlier in the year and last year. So I have some level of cautious optimism. I don't think the recent suggestion that hopefully is realizable that interest rates are going to drop has been baked into that yet, so that could be an additional stabilizing factor. Just don't see the same level of fall-off that we were seeing.

Again, I know it's a range, but how are values or appraisals different in some of your other markets like Montgomery County or Bethesda? I'm assuming it's not that much of a decline. Just any kind of color you can give on what you're seeing in those appraisals.","It has not been as severe in Bethesda. Other areas, and even within the CBD, I don't think it's been as severe as what we saw in the most recent appraisal. I think in some instances, because there aren't really any market trades going on out there right now, the bid and ask are too far apart for there to be a market transaction. What we're seeing are transactions that are at distressed levels in the CBD, which are some appraisers are interpreting to be the market is only distressed markets. And so they are using those higher factors for discounting and for cap rates. It has not happened in other markets to that level. I'm seeing a range of cap rates from 7% to I've seen as high as 9.5% on discounting office properties. I'm seeing discount rates that have been anywhere from 7% to 10.5%. So there's a pretty wide range out there. And I'm very much appreciative of the fact that we're not in a must appraise situation in the CBD for a while. I do think there's been some erosion in the suburban properties, but not nearly at the same level. A properties and trophy properties are not seeing the same level.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"You reiterated your outlook for the margin to be 250 to 270 for the year. Of course, it came in lower this quarter, but I know some of that was from that, the interest reversal. So what gets your margin? I mean, it feels like the low end of that range is kind of safe, is the safe place to be, but what gets the margin towards the mid to high end of that range? Does it take rate cuts or are there things that you're doing just within your balance sheet that you think can push that higher?","Yeah, no, I appreciate the question. And on that note, on the interest reversal, the $522,000 that Jan mentioned, we estimate that to be about seven basis points impact on the margin. So, had we not had that reversal, our NIM would have come in at 2.5% for the quarter, which is at the bottom end of that range. To answer your question about what gets us higher up in the range I think a lot of it comes down to our successes and we're starting to see that and I think it's building momentum on deposit growth from our digital channel for example and that you know while there it comes in at a higher price because that's just how you acquire that type of customer and our success in building those into deeper relationships can have the effect of reducing our cost of funds. And as we're growing the core deposit, then we're able to reduce usage of FHLB borrowings, for example. And that has a higher cost than deposits. So I think a lot of it is our liability strategy. We do have 300 and for the full year of 24, it was 340 million of investments that are rolling off our books, which is earning us about 2%. So you have the benefit of a higher yield, even if it's just sitting in cash at about 300 basis points of yield. I do think that the spread that we're seeing on new loan originations are pretty close to what the market's giving us. So I think a lot of it is our liability strategy, becoming more successful in that liability strategy in the back half of the year, and really honestly setting us up for a good 2025 and 2026.","The question inquires about factors that could improve the company's margin, which is currently at the lower end of the projected range.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"So appreciate the color on the monthly deposit trends. Just around your comments with deposits being relatively stable in April, are you still seeing movement out of non-sparing, but just sort of going into interest-bearing versus out of deposits? Is that what you're sort of seeing this month, or did I mishear that? And then I was also wondering if you might have an idea of where sort of the percentage of non-interest-bearing might land this cycle, or is it sort of too early to tell?","Yeah, I think on both those fronts, it's a little premature for me to make a call. I can say, you know, again, things are leveling off. I bet You know, there were accounts that were closed in the fourth quarter, but there were also quite a few accounts that were opened.

"Eagle Bancorp, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Okay. I'll move on to Jan. Just quickly back to office. Can you maybe just put some updated numbers around the exposure there that you give in the past, and if you had it, maybe the average loan size in that book or LPBs or just any sort of granularity you have there for us?","Okay, I will.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"So I wanted to talk through 25 expectations from the following angle. When we look at the overall scenario, we should have a better regulatory environment. Fran had mentioned potential competitive exits, which I'm curious about, but we would expect the competitive scenario to remain as good or better. And, you know, we certainly have a good macro in the number of 65-year-olds aging in. So I'm curious why there's a little bit more of a somber thought process in terms of growing the business this year.","Morning, George. Thanks for the question. I wouldn't characterize it as somber. I think it's pragmatic, given that there's a change in the administration. And the president's 37 days into his new term, so we've seen a rapid pace of change aimed at taking out costs to the government, improving efficiency, and so forth. So while we know in the first term the Trump administration was very supportive of MA, We know that Secretary Kennedy is, through the confirmation hearings, we learned that he is a member of Medicare Advantage Plan and is a very satisfied member. We also know that Dr. Oz has been rather supportive of MA. That said, it's a question of priority and timing. So until we see greater evidence, because bear in mind that the rate increase in the advance notice occurred prior to the inauguration, So that happened during the Biden administration. And it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will improve that, maintain, or potentially reduce it. So we look at that April timeline as a very important check in to see just how bullish the Trump administration is on Medicare Advantage. Judge, I also wanted to say that if you look at the switching activity last annual enrollment period, it was all time high. If you look at different industry reports, the switching reached about 20%. A year ago, it was 16. And even at that point, a year ago, it was already historically high. But we just set another record. It helps with volume, certainly. It also helps with conversion rates, because you have this high propensity to switch. And our platform was in amazing condition operationally that we were able to convert all of that demand at attractive enrollment margins that you've seen in our Q4 results. Now looking into the next Q4, it is really hard to say. It's probably not going to be as high. Where is it going to be? Is it going to be closer to 23? Is it going to be somewhere in between? We don't know yet. And so, our guidance range does reflect that range of outcomes. The last thing I would say on your question, George, is that our guidance is in line with the three-year CAGRs that we provided. So, while the roadmap looks different today than it did when we first prepared our outlook, it's tracking consistent.","The question addresses concerns about a potentially challenging business growth outlook despite favorable demographic trends and a competitive environment.

That's obviously been a strategy for quite some time. I'm curious if there have been iterations to that strategy.","Yes. The most significant part of our brand evolution has been aimed at Medicare Advantage. Over the past year, Michelle and her team have focused on creating the same kind of look on our E&I program, for example, landing pages start looking very similar to our MA landing pages. How we emphasize and feature the brand with our MedSupp is still a work in progress. E&I, a work in progress. We made important progress last year. But we're going to take it to the next level. We want consumers, whether they're under 65 or over 65, to know that eHealth can help them navigate their health insurance choices. So tremendous progress on the Medicare Advantage side.

We want to replicate that for all of our product lines.","The speaker confirms that their brand strategy has evolved, particularly focusing on Medicare Advantage, with efforts to unify branding across different programs.

I appreciate the change in marketing outlook through the year based on changes in DSNP rules, but just wondering what your how you're thinking about 4Q in the context of maybe some of that D-SNP volume moving into the fourth quarter and kind of how you're thinking about that versus your kind of normal cadence that we would see kind of prior to these changes.","Good morning, Ben. Thanks for the question. We did take that into our assumptions for fourth quarter that there would be likely more e-SNP opportunities in Q4, given that we don't have those opportunities in Q2 and Q3. The other component of this is, you know, CMS's change in our, the industry's ability to assist beneficiaries through an SEP associated with a natural disaster. I'm hopeful that they're going to revisit that in light things that are going on with respect to headcounts, including HHS.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"And just a follow-up question, too, on the Amplify platform. I appreciate the commentary of the drivers of the weakness that you saw relative to your agent platform. But I just wanted to get your reasons to believe that we're kind of maybe at a trough that it improves from here. I mean, many of the carriers that are focused on profitability are pointing to a multi-year path to target margins. And I'm just wondering, you know, kind of what gives you confidence in kind of that, in a change of tide there in Amplify for this year and next?","Sure. Well, let me start with reminding everyone that Amplify is a little over a year old. So it's a new business for eHealth, and its evolution is moving very, very nicely. And, you know, we're putting more emphasis on building the pipeline. And a lot of that is coming through sort of word of mouth. We're delivering on our carrier partners' expectations with respect to conversion and the quality and compliance and the experience that their customers are getting with us.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Fran, if you could quantify a little bit what you're referencing in terms of the larger pipeline early in the AEP and also your ability or what you're seeing in terms of the converting that demand at what you're saying is a greater rate than a year ago. Just curious if we can get a little more detail on those.","Oh, good morning, George. Thanks for the question. The pipeline, we built a pipeline in 2023, but we put it on steroids this year. And we have greater visibility, obviously with the degree of changes that are occurring where either beneficiaries were losing their current Medicare Advantage organization because of a market exit or service area reduction or their plan was withdrawn. We saw a number of PPO plans that have been withdrawn in different parts of the country. So we know those folks have to make change. They don't have an option. And we certainly don't want them to enter January without having health insurance coverage. So we went on offense to the extent that we had email addresses, phone numbers. We started a very robust outreach program. And we didn't give up on the first call, the second call, the third call. We continued to dial and make other efforts to outreach. That has provided us with an opportunity to hit the ground running on October 15th. So we were able to begin making care of those needs right out of the gate. So I called the team for outstanding execution. As far as more specifics on, I'm not gonna provide you a metric. We'll have to bear with us until we complete the AEP and prepare to announce two full earnings. But you know, we had a very significant growth last year. And in the first three weeks of the AEP, we have not only surpassed our internal forecast in a meaningful way, but certainly also the very high base. So again, we're looking at this holistically in terms of our retention and new opportunities. You know, millions of people, current Medicare Advantage members were affected by plan withdrawals and service area reductions. So I think there is a greater sense of urgency, higher motivation for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries to shop this year. So we're being opportunistic in meeting those needs, both for retention and with new opportunities.","Fran highlighted that their outreach efforts have significantly increased this year due to changes in the Medicare Advantage landscape, leading to greater demand and conversion rates.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"So it's particularly encouraging given what I would have thought early in the season was going to be limited ability to get in front of people given all the political advertising. I'm just curious, if the rest of the season relative to changes in advertising you might be doing, I'm curious if I'll see a lot more of Eve for the rest of the season. And would you expect that the AEP could get extended?","Okay, let me break those down. You have three very good questions there. As far as the concerns with the national election, that we, you know, the industry would have difficulty getting that message through. We've not experienced that particularly with our DRTV. People have been glued to their TVs over the last few weeks and leading up to last night's conclusions or I guess I should say early this morning's conclusions. We buy our DRTV on a national basis. And a lot of the political messaging advertisements are done on a local market basis. So we were able to get our message across if you tuned into, you know, CNN, Fox, we make sure we represent both sides of the aisle in our outreaches. You would have seen us, those messages. We all get calls from our family members when they see us on TV. So we know people are watching. All of our channels right now are performing above our expectations, leading to lower COAs, higher conversion rates. So we're generating quality leads. That's really, you know, it's success. It gets success and it invokes more confidence with particularly our less tenured agents. You know, they're enjoying success and closing customers, which I think is gonna serve us well for the balance of AEP and into January's OEP. I can't tell you anything new as far as whether, you know, CMS will grant an extension or offer a special enrollment period. I've seen reasonably close contact with key people at CMS. I'll be outreaching to them in a follow-up to a meeting we had in person a few weeks back. Just giving them some metrics in terms of what we're observing. We have a very transparent relationship with CMS and it's not uncommon for them to either confirm that they're seeing similar kinds of higher volumes with their call center.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Just one other thing for John, if I could. We saw you had reduced the constraint recently and you saw your tele revenues come in much more limited than in the past. Do we feel really good about the constraint change we made? Are we gonna see relatively small tail revenues ahead?","Thanks, George. I think we continue to analyze our performance, the volatility and the LTV trends that we've seen over time and we remain confident the change that we made was the right change. When we analyzed it, we did have a range of various outcomes and we actually chose the conservative route and booked more at the lower end. So there was opportunity to actually take the constraint down lower. We considered the current environment and we chose our constraints and we maintained the appropriate level of conservatism in our process. When we look at our tail, we have over $200 million in cumulative positive tail since the adoption of 606.

"eHealth, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"I wanted to talk, Fran, if we could, about the political spend within the context of how you're going to go to market this AEP.

And have you gotten any feedback from your letters to CMS to really encourage a longer shopping season?","Good morning, George. Hey, thank you. Let me start with the first question regarding the national election. We, you know, we've experienced this before. He went back and looked at how this played out four years ago. And, you know, because of our omnichannel capabilities, we use multiple channels to reach beneficiaries. EV is problematic in those first three weeks of EV because of the national election. And then it opens up. So we'll shift more of our dollars to direct mail and SEO and SEM and paid search and other channels that generally aren't as affected by the national election as TV is. And as far as CMS's reaction, I've had two communications with CMS on this topic. they've not uh they've acknowledged uh what i outlined as sort of the proverbial perfect storm uh with you know more shopping likely to occur this year and the national election and thanksgiving coming late in november and aep ending on a saturday i mean it's all those factors um i think are going to make it a little more challenging for beneficiaries to get through so adding five or six days the back end just sort of makes sense we know we can't go too much beyond that because carriers need to get id cards out in advance of january 1. so there's a there's a natural cutoff in order to avoid unintended consequences they've listened they've acknowledged uh unclear whether they're going to act uh so i will you know continue to encourage that and there'll be a byline coming out uh in the next few weeks um from me uh encouraging action sooner rather than later","The question addresses how to adjust marketing budgets during the political season and whether there has been feedback from CMS about extending the shopping period.

Yes, we've been working on strategies really for the past several months now and we'll continue to refine those strategies, but we expect this upcoming AEP to be one of those situations where it best demonstrates the value proposition of e-health in respect to what we anticipate be a fair amount of disruption because of the pressures that Medicare Advantage health plans and carriers are experiencing through all the items that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Part of this is offense, of course, right? There's gonna be, we anticipate a lot more beneficiaries who are accustomed to a certain level of supplemental benefits and other benefits that they value that may see changes and potentially significant changes. I think the pressures on the Part D side, both on the MAPD and the standalone Part D are also gonna be a source of shopping. And then of course, we expect, as some of the national carriers have already said publicly, basically everything's on the table for them, including geographic market exits and some of the other pressures they're gonna feel through the limitations imposed by CMS through the total beneficiary cost to TBC where they may end up having to phase out a product and introduce a new product in that market which doesn't allow them to convert those beneficiaries automatically. They have to resell them and that's where we come in the place to help with that process.

We're preparing for everything we can to alert our customers where they will likely experience the greatest disruption in the, I'd say the areas that you can focus on more intently is where there's gonna be geographic exits and knowing that you're gonna need to intervene and move those beneficiaries into an alternative product if that carrier is exited, the current carrier.

There still remains the CMS marketing guidelines to be published And I think it really comes down to one component of the 48-hour rule, and that specifically is with respect to whether appointments are necessary when a beneficiary is responding to, say, a postcard or some other direct mail or other marketing communications. Most of our volume is really inbound that does not require the 48-hour scope of appointment. So we still feel very good about that situation. That said, we've increased our appointment setting capabilities because we think that it's a value add for customers, prospective customers to, you know, we're a society that likes instant gratification.

It's Fran. Let me start this off. Thanks for the question. We're still in the process of meeting with our robust carrier options. The team is still having meetings with both some of our largest carrier partners as well as some of the regional and local carriers. So it's pretty fluid at this point. That said, early indications are, you know, If you've seen one, you've seen one, meaning one carrier in one market. I think it's oftentimes lost in the conversation that we tend to describe like star scores on averages, but in fact, they vary on a contract-by-contract basis, which usually denotes a defined geography. So as I've said in my earlier remarks, I think it's going to play out that there are going to be markets where certain carriers are very strong and markets where they may not be as strong as they were this year.

So I wondered if you can go into more detail on that. And second, you, in a couple years past, had a confirmation call at the end of the transaction. I'm just curious, would this just simply be, rather than an immediate confirmation call, a call that's set up in 48 hours?","Good morning, George. It's Fran. Thank you for the questions. Let me address them in the order that you raised them. The 48-hour rule was just really a catalyst to accelerate what we had been planning for all along, and that was, how can we add additional dimensions to our strategic partner relationships? And so, what I can't get into too much detail because it's premature, but I can confirm that we are exploring multiple alternatives to be more in touch with or more aligned with the local nature of healthcare. You know, we even made modifications to our telesales operating structure last year. again, getting closer to the local market because healthcare is local. So, with respect to our strategic partners, I think we'll be in a place to provide a little more color as we report out Q2, but I will reinforce that we are looking at multiple opportunities there. As far as the second question, you know, when When this rule first became public in its draft form seeking comments, that was really our call to action in terms of scenario planning. And we looked at, you know, multiple possible outcomes. And on our telesales side, we already have a pretty robust capability on the appointment scheduling side. In fact, we always start the AEP season out using the marketing period as an opportunity to schedule appointments that go live on October 15th, the start of AEP. We are going to be expanding that capability so that the scheduling technology is even more robust. But essentially, you know, as you characterized it, I would say that that's one way of doing it. We will use AI where we can so that we could notified people of their appointments through emails and texts. So we want to be very smart and efficient and customer-centric in how we approach this because people like to communicate in different forms, not always by phone, but by text and email.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Tom, CLO liability spreads have tightened dramatically with a lack of M&A, sort of limiting new CLO creation. As you've been involved in this market through many cycles, how do you see CLO debt liability spreads trending over the next couple of years?","I don't know where they're going to be tomorrow. Good morning. Tomorrow they're probably around the same and maybe a little tighter. Over time, CLO debt tranches of which EIC invests in have performed exceptionally well from a total return perspective, certainly relative to the ratings at an absolute instance of loss. CLO double Bs have had I think it's a four basis point default rate annually over the last 30 years. Tronch is above that. Generally have even lower default rates obviously. You get paid very well. So AAAs today generically are 115 over. That's a five and five and a half percent return, give or take. That's pretty darn attractive for an asset class that's never had a pick, let alone the default. That spread has always been wider than most other widespread broadly accepted structured products. Even going back to the pre-financial crisis days, CLO is always wide to the CNBS and things like that. It should continue to trend tighter. An option that CLO debt investors write is a little bit of a spread option. If historic credit expenses are very low, the one thing that's less certain compared to other forms of structured products is the call write. While we're very happy at EIC and that generated eight cents of realized gains for us this quarter, the vast majority of that were CLOs that were called and paid off at we had bought the double Vs at a discount proverbially yesterday. The bad news is now we have to go reinvest and in general we're reinvesting those might have been 700 over bonds or 600 over bonds. We're reinvesting in a 500 over market. So on one hand, relative to the credit expense, CLO debt spreads are very, very wide in my opinion, even at today's tight levels. That said, we're facing reinvestment risk or we're having to reinvest tighter than the stuff that's getting called out and it's because equity investors are calling deals and refinancing them tighter, resetting them or refinancing them or calling them. So it should continue to grow grind tighter over time based on credit experience in the asset class. The one variability is the call write which is not embedded in a lot of other ABS or CNBS type products, not the way it is in CLOs. So holders of CLO debt are writing some degree of spread option but in our view we're getting very, very well compensated for it.","Tom discusses the tightening of CLO liability spreads and their potential future trends, noting that while current spreads are attractive and have historically low default rates, reinvestment risks exist as older bonds are called and replaced with tighter ones.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Yeah, I agree with that view Tom and I suppose that's sort of the backdrop in your prepared remarks of why you're looking at increasing your allocation to CLO equity. And you've also increased your allocation to CFO debt and equity. So those are generating very nice yields for you. Could you just highlight the risks in CFOs compared to CLOs and how high are you willing to go with your allocation to CFO and CLO equity?","Sure, so for CLO equity I think we... Hang on one second. I'm looking at 30 minutes. CLO equity, we do state in our materials, I wanted to make sure I had the number right. For everything we kind of target no more than 35 percent. So it's 65 percent double B sort of minimum in our management. You never want to go all the way to the extremes on these things. Could we see CLO equity get to 30 percent of the portfolio? That doesn't strike me as crazy. Obviously it's all market dependent but that's something I would see going potentially going up a little bit. But certainly overall we have the hard minimum of 65 percent CLO debt which I would obviously that we don't plan to tinker with that. So broadly could you see CLO equity going up a bit I think would be the one change if you had to think what could happen depending on market conditions in our portfolio. To talk about CFOs and we have just a small number of positions in here. These are investments that popped up. We've got three different vehicles and we have different tranches of them and some equity. This kind of comes from an eagle point as a firm. We have a large and robust CFO investment program. We have certainly hundreds of millions of dollars maybe even you know probably it's well over half a billion not a billion of invested in this market here at EIC has you know 13 million give or take of fair value plus or minus a tiny bit. It's a relatively very very small portion of the portfolio and these investments you know presented particularly attractive opportunities and you can see by the the yields on the CFO debt and then the expected yield effective yields on the CFO equity. We hope every investment yields that well obviously they you know those are kind of real peaches to find those when they do. In general we're not a big buyer of CFO equity but there are a few special exceptions particularly these secondary funds which we think have a real upside potential. In many cases the borrowers the companies in these underlying vehicles are the same companies that are the borrowers and CLOs so we're the underlying credits in these are principally corporate credit just the same that we've seen in CLOs. In some cases though this is the equity of those companies owned through funds. We're moving a little bit down in the capital structure with them. The flip side these are very very attractive risk adjusted yields for sure. The amount of subordination below the average CFO debt tranche is much greater than a CLO debt tranche. Order of magnitude could be 2x the amount of subordination generically if you think of a CFO a CLO is having 8% higher subordination to a double B tranche. A CFO in many cases would have 20% subordination some may be higher some may be lower but generically that's where I think we have a bunch more subordination coming in. And then with the secondaries ones one of the things that makes secondary investing in LP markets so attractive is these folks are generically able to buy LP interest at 80 to 90 cents of fair value providing liquidity for someone who's in a locked up vehicle but they have to take a discount to get it. It's always a good idea to buy I'll take the midpoint of that 85 it's always a good thing to buy 100 at 85 if you have the wherewithal to hold it and certainly these CFOs do and EIC does. That said there's risk the underlying of most of this is equity of the same companies but not necessarily credit of the same companies. That said CFO debt is a credit instrument against that portfolio and these folks all have great track records doing what they do. A little bit of a long answer I wouldn't expect this portion of the portfolio to grow significantly could it grow a little bit possibly highly highly selective when EIC participates in investments like these but you can see from the yields you know we we always like buying hundred dollar bills for 85 cents on the dollar we're getting locked up to hold it for a while but that's that's the thing that makes these attractive and then the debt I wish all our COO double V's yielded with these with these CFO debt tranches are yielding a little bit different risk profile but a lot more equity subordination.","The question discusses the rationale behind increasing allocations to CLO equity and CFO debt and equity, while asking about the risks associated with CFOs compared to CLOs and potential allocation limits. The answer explains that while CLO equity could rise to 30% of the portfolio, CFO investments are limited and carry higher subordination risks, but they offer attractive yields, making them selectively appealing.",0,0,0,0,7,1,0.749999906,0.242424235,11,1,0.833333264,0.040133779,68,21,0.528089882,0.297658862,2,0,0,15,0,2
Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q4 2024,Financial Services,Looks really interesting Tom. My last question is following I calculate the weighted average cash yield in EIC's CLO equity investments to have remained in the mid-20s but the weighted average effective yield keeps ticking down as the arbitrage has been challenged with such tight loan spreads. You know we've talked about this many times over the years but over time those yields need to track each other so yeah how do you see that relationship develop and given that you know cash yields remain so attractive.,Hey Mickey it's Dan Coe here. Hi Dan. Hey how are you? And so we see certainly as you mentioned the cash yields remaining very very attractive but CLO equity you know when we kind of calculate an effective yield we are factoring in that we're not going to get necessarily 100 cents on the dollar back kind of at the end you know CLO equity typically does not get that amount obviously if we do that's great but you know I guess our base case is that we get somewhere between kind of 40 to 60 cents on the dollar back at the end so that kind of I guess explains why the cash yields are so high but then the effective yields are much lower than that. I guess the effective yields also have been somewhat affected by some of the spread compression that we've been seeing in the market on the loan side but we've also been kind of counteracting that with some of refinancing and reset activity that we've been doing to cut the liability costs on the CLO debt side of the equations to kind of balance that out. So on one hand I'm complaining that our bonds are getting ripped out of us and paid off at par we love the gains that we're realizing we hope we you know can't forecast it but we love eight cents of gains that's great. Bad news we're reinvesting at lower spreads that's for our CLO double B portfolio. Good news for our CLO equity portfolios we can reset those double Bs tighter which yeah we did a number in this CLO this fund had a number of resets and we'll continue to do them whenever possible. So what our weighted average spread on the loans was down but our weighted average AAA you know every time we do a reset we're usually lowering our costs there too so we want to keep it as low as possible on the right side and one really nice thing you know loan spreads will move up and down over time if spreads gap out tomorrow which is not what we're predicting but if it were to happen the new CLO debt spreads that we're locking in today as an equity for our equity book it lasts for five or seven years so if loan spreads widen we've still got today's cheap AAA locked in.,"The question discusses the relationship between weighted average cash yields and effective yields in CLO equity investments, noting that cash yields remain attractive despite declining effective yields due to tight loan spreads. In response, Dan Coe explains that while cash yields are high, effective yields are lower due to expected recovery rates and market spread compression, but refinancing efforts help manage costs and maintain favorable conditions for CLO equity portfolios.",2,2,0,0.095238093,6,3,0.333333296,0.214285709,6,3,0.333333296,0.058441558,28,15,0.302325574,0.279220777,0,0,0,5,0,0
Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"I want to talk about the WB market because you're a unique vehicle out there. What do you see? So on acquisitions, can you go over primary and secondary? On the prior call, you said on this ECC call, you said there was a big difference on acquisitions. on spreads on the equity side. I want to hear about the BBB side, and I want to hear about tiering. I mean, what's going on with the tiers among the managers? Is there much of a difference these days?","Hey, Matt, this is Dan Coe here. In terms of spreads, I'd say that despite the recent Fed rate cuts, CLBBs have actually held in pretty well in terms of kind of prices. We've actually seen prices rally despite the Fed rate cuts and these being floating rate CLO debt securities. Now, the current cash yields certainly are falling as the base rates are falling, but you have to remember that, I guess, the spread on CLO double Bs is a larger chunk of kind of the yield or return than other kind of, I guess, other floating rate securities. Right. A little less impacted there, certainly on the overall yield. And then to your question about tiering, we are certainly seeing tiering compress within the Tier 1 and Tier 3 collateral managers out there. But then we're also seeing tiering between new issue and resets as well. So for a new issue portfolio that's being issued today, you have much cleaner portfolios, no tail in the portfolio, less stressed assets, whereas resets, while obviously it is it is nice to have a portfolio in place that's already ramped. There are some stressed assets that are in the portfolio. So we do see potentially even 100 basis points of difference in terms of kind of the spreads that we're seeing on new issue versus resets.","Dan Coe discusses the current state of the CLO market, noting that despite Fed rate cuts, CLO double Bs have maintained stable prices, with spreads being a significant part of their yield.

Now, there are obviously some that are at a discount, but those are the ones that you might not want to be touching at a discount, in fairness. And so I think that there's still opportunities to buy some stuff at a discount or even things There's some interesting opportunities at a premium, but new issue, there's a better balance in value between new issue and secondary today as secondary has rallied a bunch.","The discussion highlights the differences between primary and secondary CLO double Bs, noting that while many have returned to par value, there are still opportunities in both discounted and premium assets.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"And then these discounts that you do own, I mean, as they prepay at par, I mean, how much – this is a – it's sort of a – I almost look at it as like a double-edged sword. I mean, you love to have the yields on them, but you get these gains as they pay off at par. I mean, how much is left – in the portfolio of those and how we should, you know, think about, like, the contribution going forward of those, you know, those prepays.","Yeah, no, it's a good point. We certainly see the benefits of being able to realize the convexity sooner. And so we take those kind of realized gains. But then you're right. I mean, we're losing out on some of the wider yielding stuff. I'd say that a large chunk of the portfolio still was purchases that we made at discounts that we do still see. potential for, I guess, the gains to come through.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Okay. And then moving towards, I mean, just the portfolio, it's doubled basically in a year. You're the only real vehicle out there that – goes, you know, that does these double Bs. You know, talk a little bit about, I mean, just, you know, four bips of annual losses. I mean, it's just so low. I mean, it's just incredible. It's like almost like, you know, why aren't more people doing this? But you guys have the efficiency in this vehicle. Your cost of capital is going lower. You get more efficient as you grow. Tom, what is the right kind of yield requirement, if I can kind of ask you to put your equity analyst cap on me, what should this vehicle be compared to? Maybe I'll ask you that out there in other kind of risk type vehicles, because it just doesn't seem like you're exposed to much losses in these BBs.","Well, certainly the historic data that you cite is spot on. I just pulled up on Bloomberg right here, the distribution rate kind of pencils out to a high 14s yield right now, which in our opinion certainly is is way cheap compared to private credit is probably the closest comp. And there, I don't know what you have a view on a generic BDC dividend yield. Right now, we're pulling up 9%, give or take, 10%. The thing that's forgotten, and while many private credit managers are pretty darn good at what they do, There's always going to be a few problems. There's always a handful of names on non-accrual. We have nothing in our BB book that's non-accrual. It's just that concept doesn't exist. Coupled with our capital structure is really quite attractive as well. I mean, we still have some 5% paper outstanding. Sadly, that matures in 2026, but we've got a very attractive right side of our balance sheet as well. And then, frankly, the fee structure in EIC is far more favorable than a typical BDC. And when you think about the fees charged on many of the large public BDCs, we're making investments here in higher-yielding assets with lower instance of historic loss and charging less to do it, yet there's still a very material difference between the distribution return on distribution yield on EIC versus many of the BDCs. That's supposed to compress. One of the things we're really pleased with with the company has been the increase in volume. And we talked about that. I think it roughly tripled on a year-over-year basis. So just getting the company a little more to scale as it's grown. Volume begets volume. We want our stockholders to have a liquid stock that they can hopefully buy more than sell, but actively trade no matter what. And we've got to keep getting this message out about the resilience of the underlying asset class, the high cash flows that it generates. And in our opinion, the premium distribution yield on our stock versus BDCs is supposed to compress. It takes time to do it. ECC has been in the market for a decade. We're slowly getting there. This one obviously has a head start because people knew us to begin with, but in our opinion, the distribution opportunity that you get from buying into EIC is mispriced in the investor's favor.","The question highlights the impressive growth and low losses of a specific investment vehicle, prompting a comparison of its yield to other risk vehicles.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc.,Q3 2024,Financial Services,"On just the asset class itself, it's only 4% to 6% of a typical CLO, but it's big enough – I mean, it's big enough where you could still double, triple the size of EIC. It's big enough for you guys to grow.","Yeah, and just to throw out, yes is the short answer. To throw some generic numbers, if you think of the U.S. CLO market as about a trillion-dollar market, the BB class is about 4%, so that's about $40 billion. Our assets are about $400 million, give or take, so we're 1% of the market in this vehicle. Now, at Eagle Point, we do manage other accounts and vehicles that have CLO BBs. So collectively, we own the billions of dollars of CLO BBs. This is not our only vehicle that invests in the strategy. Against that, what makes it stay so attractive, in my opinion, you think of the vastness of the corporate BB market, where you buy high-yield bonds, BBs, and the hundreds of billions of dollars. For the average kind of rating-sensitive insurance company or someone like that who might want to buy, this is just too small of a market to get that excited about. On the investment-grade side, the tranches are bigger and bigger, and they can put bigger sums of money to work. But if you're running a general account with $100 billion, $500 billion like some of the large life companies have, They're very active in the single A and double A part of the capital structure in CLOs. And while they buy lots of double B-rated bonds on their balance sheet as well, I'm sure just getting involved in a $40 billion market just is too small of a piece of the opportunity for their pie chart. So for EIC, we see a lot of room for growth in terms of the investment opportunity set is tremendous. And because of that structural imbalance of it, while it's an important part of a big trillion-dollar market financing a roughly $1.4 trillion leveraged loan market in the United States, this little slug is only $40 billion, which then gets overlooked by a lot of large institutional investors, not due to the quality, just due to the scale of the opportunity. And again, if you're running a large life insurance company, that's just too small of a market to get involved in for EIC. we're a long way from worried about capacity in terms of the market.","The CLO BB class represents about 4% of the U.S. CLO market, equating to roughly $40 billion, which is considered too small for large institutional investors to prioritize.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Kathy, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the change in the loss pick for current accident year? And then you've been holding steady at 64 for a while, and you've been holding steady at 60. A lot of the same dynamics seemingly have been at play, the lower loss costs, the medical inflation, et cetera. Why now? What do you see in the marketplace that motivates you to increase the loss pick?","Yeah, so, Mark, our current accident year loss and LAE ratio is determined annually by our actuaries, and they consider the pricing environment of each of our states and the growth prospects that we have in those states. They also look at the trends and frequency and severity and any initiatives that we might be implementing within the year that we feel could impact our results. You know, I would say that our philosophy or our approach has not changed. We generally like to choose a ratio at the beginning of the year that's based on the current environment, and we like to leave it there until there's a compelling reason to change it. As you said, our crude and reserving philosophy and the continued competitive rate environment led us to select a 2024 accident year loss and LAE ratio of 64%. That was slightly higher than what we chose for 2023, which was 63.3%, and that has been consistent for a while. We have the same loss pick in 2022. When I mentioned that we do expect to increase our accident year loss and LAE ratio in 2025, the primary drivers there are some higher actuarial trend selections, and as I mentioned, the ongoing competitive rate environment. What I would say is we do see also improvement in our expense ratio, but that will be mitigated to some extent by the change in the loss and LAE ratio that we're expecting. You know, I'd just also add that the change that we are expecting will be directionally consistent with the work comp industry, which has been, you know, increasing the current accident year loss pick for several years, and we've been coming in below that.","Kathy explains that the increase in the accident year loss and LAE ratio to 64% for 2024, up from 63.3% in 2023, reflects ongoing competitive market conditions and higher actuarial trends, despite a consistent approach to setting these ratios.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"And then you said the higher actuarial trend selection. That phrase carries a lot of weight. Can you maybe say what trends are driving that frequency, severity, medical?","Yeah. Yeah, so, you know, when we look at frequency, and we always do that based on our own level of premium, our loss time claim frequency has continued to trend downward over the last several years. We do not expect that trend to change. When we adjust for the change in wages, our overall claim severity values have really held fairly steady in the most recent years, and they remain, generally speaking, below the pre-pandemic levels, and that's been driven by lower medical severity. Indemnity severity, I would say, is trending about the same as wage inflation. And up to this point, medical inflation in the economic data has remained relatively mild, especially when you look at it in relation to other sectors like energy or housing or food, so that's good news. So, you know, the pressure is really just coming from a little bit more conservatism and what we're seeing, you know, broadly in the industry. I will add that the accident year loss and LAE ratio pick for 2023 that we saw coming out of last year's state of the line was a 69. I'm not suggesting that that's what we are collecting in any way, shape, or form, but I'm just saying that we have been well below the industry for many, many years. The wage inflation that you might have seen in earlier years, I think, ended up being beneficial, you know, since medical inflation was benign. It was essentially kind of a, I won't say hidden, but an extra amount of premium that might have offset any kind of inflation in any trends around severity.","The speaker discusses trends in actuarial data, noting that while claim frequency has decreased and severity remains stable, there is a cautious outlook due to broader industry conditions.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q4 2024,Financial Services,"I guess maybe the fact that you're not seeing as much wage inflation, does that then put a little more pressure on the current accident year? Is that a, does that make sense or is it off base?","No, I mean, that does make sense. I'll tell you, you know, when I look at the BLS numbers, as of December, the annual change in employment and hourly wages was .3% for all sectors and .5% for leisure and hospitality, which is where we have a big concentration. Those numbers compared to .1% and .1% a year ago. So it's that reduction in the acceleration of employment and wages that's impacting our book of business and it's impacting it by decreasing the audit pickups and the audit accrual that we have, and that's putting a bit of pressure on our net written premiums.

That segment of business is operating at a loss in LEAE ratio that's very similar, if not slightly better than our traditional target classes. It's really contributing to our overall growth.

What you'll see when we file our 10K is that we increased our letter of credit issued by about $100 million through the Federal Home Loan Bank, and we used that to satisfy deposit requirements in California, which permitted us to liberate some of the lower yielding assets that we had on deposit with California. And we sold those in the quarter and recognized a small realized loss on those of just over $2 million. But what that allowed us to do is to go along with residential mortgage-backed securities that were yielding near 6%. You know, a pretty big increase over what we were getting with these deposits. With the Federal Home Loan Bank, we only have to pay a 15 basis point letter of credit fee. So that will have a little bit of an uplift in our net investment income for next year.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Now, under the circumstances, are we to think that the risk of future medical inflation is limited if a fee schedule is there? And many other states, I'm not exactly sure of the numbers, but if those are tied to those fee schedules, I assume the government is going to be just as motivated to suppress those costs in the future as they have been in the past. So should we think that medical inflation is less of a risk?","Well, I think generally speaking, the industry has done a really nice job over the last more than a decade of putting medical cost containment measures into place, and those would include medical fee schedules for hospitals, physicians, inpatient and outpatient, and so forth. Many but not all of those fee schedules are tied to Medicare, and so I would think they would move somewhat in tandem. But the fee schedules that have been put in place have been very successful. I mean, you mentioned California in particular, you know, back in, I think it was back in 2013 when they passed Senate Bill 863. That was highly successful, wildly more successful than I think anyone predicted. And so, I would just say generally speaking, the fee schedules and workers' compensation are working and they are helping to keep medical costs under control.","The question inquires whether fee schedules can limit future medical inflation, suggesting that government efforts will continue to suppress costs.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q2 2024,Financial Services,"When we think about the top line outlook, audit premiums are still positive, not as positive as they've been, but we've talked about the kind of your expansion and appetite and you could throw in competition. Any kind of general commentary about what you expect when it comes to top-line growth, keeping in mind all the different drivers?","Yeah, I mean, I'm pleased with the level of top-line growth that we're seeing. We did see some pressure this quarter in terms of offsetting costs. The new and renewal business growth, there was an offset in terms of audit pickup slowing down. We also decreased our audit accrual during the quarter. None of it I would say is surprising to me, though, when you look at the underlying economic conditions. As of June, just to give you a few numbers, the BLS, annual change in employment, and hourly wages for leisure and hospitality, which is where a lot of our focus is... So that is what is putting pressure on our audit pickups, and it's also causing us to decrease our audit accrual, and it's bringing our top-line growth down a bit. We're not seeing decreases in terms of the new business premium that's coming through, and our renewal premiums continue to be strong, too. So just to give you a couple of numbers, we ended the quarter with an audit accrual of $34.2 million, and that's a decrease of $5.1 million this quarter. That compares to an increase in the second quarter of 2023. So, you know, that decrease in accrual was a meaningful contributor to both written and earned premium this quarter. But then when you look at audit pickup, they were 4.9 million this quarter versus 7.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. Like I said earlier, if you exclude the final audit pickup and the change in a pool, our gross written premium was up about 10% in the second quarter of 24 relative to the second quarter of 2023. Endorsement premium is also coming in very strong. We recognize about $13 million in endorsements and about $3 million in noncompliant premiums. So the growth that we're seeing is coming from, you know, all of our major distribution channels. Like I said, strong endorsement premium. You mentioned appetite expansion. That is a meaningful contributor to the growth. I think about $41 million of our premium this quarter came from our appetite expansion efforts.

But I believe NCCI is projecting a 5.6% increase in costs as a result of those legislative changes. But as you said, the truth of the matter is, you know, with Florida being the last remaining administered pricing state, there isn't a whole lot that we can do if we disagree with the pricing, you know, other than tighten our underwriting standards.

And then alongside that, you know, what states are you seeing the strongest growth out of and which states are a little more of a struggle?","Yeah, sure. So, you know, we're really pleased with the level of growth that we're currently seeing. And it's widespread. It's arising from all of our major distribution channels. During the first quarter, our enforced premium from our core agency segment increased. Those are our independent agents and our national partners. That premium increased by about 9%. And then our SPA segment, which is specialty, payroll, and alternative distribution, increased by 22%. A lot of that was driven by the alternative distribution channel, which is our digital book. You know, I've mentioned in the past we continue to see a big shift towards API utilization. So we're seeing major upticks in our submissions and our quotes and our binds because we put a lot of energy into providing ease to our distribution partners in terms of finding the policies. And then, you know, I'd also say our appetite expansion effort is contributing to that overall growth. that business is performing at a loss ratio similar to our other target classes.

So the charity savings were pretty much as expected. And as we mentioned before, they nearly fully emerged in the first quarter. So no surprises there. We mentioned payroll and benefit costs, and those are seasonally higher in the first quarter because all kinds of things reset. So if you look year over year, you'll see that that's kind of seasonably higher. I think what you're referring to in this quarter in a bit of a non-recurring manner is we did have about $1.5 million of incremental bad debt expense. And that related to some noncompliant policies.

What is the medical inflation as you see it now? What kind of buffer are you putting in, maybe not expectation, but in case medical inflation does pick up?","Yeah. So, you know, up to this point, and I like the fact that you said in case medical inflation does pick up, but because up to this point, medical inflation and the economic data that, you know, we review has remained relatively mild when you compare it to other sectors like energy or housing or food. And so that's really good news for workers' compensation and for us. We continue to monitor our prescription drug costs. We started doing that about a year ago.

Is that a real thing based on your experience or is there less reason to think there might be a delayed impact on medical cost inflation?","Well, you know, I would agree with what you said.

You have talked about your expansion and appetite for new class codes. I wonder if you could say whether you think the environment on a go-forward basis Is it good enough that it should allow you to kind of expand at a similar pace? Are you looking at other expansions that perhaps can increase your underwriting appetite? Just kind of a sense on the top line dynamic here.","Yeah. Well, let me give you a few numbers and then I'll talk a little bit more about the appetite expansion effort. During the third quarter, we increased our audit accrual by $1.2 million, and so that now stands at $40.2 million. That compares to what we did in Q3 of 2022 when we increased our audit accrual by $9 million. So there's a bit of a difference there. Also, audit pickups remained strong in the third quarter. That totaled about $7.4 million, which compares to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2022. So when you exclude, as you were mentioning, all the final audit pickup and change in accrual amounts, our gross written premium increased about 12% in the third quarter of 2023 relative to the third quarter of 2022. So yes, we still do have double digit growth when you take out the audit premium adjustments. We also recognized about $14.5 million in endorsements in the third quarter, and that's up $3.5 million from last year. In addition, about $1.3 million came through in noncompliance premium. So as expired policies are being audited, we endorse the enforced policies upward to reflect that change in payroll, and that's generating a tailwind for endorsements. So we are bullish on our opportunities for growth. We continue to look at opportunities to expand our appetite. And we formed a committee to do that. They are still in effect. And we're looking at class codes that we can open up in 2024. Just to give you an idea of how that's impacting our growth, Through September 30th, new business was at $115 million of written premium and about $40 million of that is coming from our appetite expansion classes.

Employers Holdings Inc,Q1 2023,Financial Services,"Kathy, I was hoping maybe you could just kind of give us a high-level view of obviously a dynamic environment. And you noticed, you know, the accident-year loss ratio pick improved a little bit. Could you just maybe peel things back a little bit and understand kind of what's going on with what you're seeing in frequency and severity trends? You know, pricing, I know that can vary a bit by state, but actually California is a big piece. And then maybe the last piece I'm most interested in is what you're seeing in kind of the payroll growth or really from a wage inflation perspective and what feel you might have for how much of that might act like rate versus what might be more true exposure.","Okay, yes. So let me start with the accident year loss ratio that you mentioned. You know, our current accident year loss and LAE ratio is determined by our actuaries. And it considers everything from the pricing environment of each state that we're in and our growth prospects in those states. It also looks at the trends we're seeing in frequency and severity. And then finally, any initiatives that we may be implementing that we feel could impact our results. So yes, we did choose a slightly lower accident year loss and LAE ratio this year. I certainly wouldn't read too much into the change that you're seeing. We generally like to choose a ratio at the beginning of the year, given the current environment, and we'll leave it there until there's some compelling reason to change it. So that's sort of the methodology behind how we choose our current accident-year loss ratio. In regards to pricing, you mentioned, for the business sectors and the premium sizes that we write, we would continue to characterize the environment as quite competitive, especially for the smallest policy sizes. We're having a bit more success finding policies that are generally larger than our average policy size, which runs anywhere from around $5,200. I would attribute that success to the new sales and underwriting operating model that I referenced earlier. For our renewal book, when we adjust for changes in exposure, our first quarter 2023 average pricing is showing A small year-over-year rate decrease, but that does vary by state. California continues to be our largest state. It's about 45% of our book and our results there are quite favorable. We've recently refined our pricing methodology in California and we believe that that's going to open up some more opportunities there. The combination of our appetite expansion and the economic factors that are currently in play led us to a 16% increase in California premium for the first quarter of 23 relative to 22. I was just reading this week that the WCIRB Governing Committee just voted to file for a pure premium increase of about 0.3%. And that, according to the press release, was due to some downward indemnity development, some stable medical development, and some flat frequency that they're seeing there. Still yet to be seen what Commissioner Lara will approve, though. In regards to our frequency and severity, when we look at it based on on-level premium, accident year 2022, Frequency is down from prior years, and so far 2023, obviously still very early to tell, but it's emerging lower as well. And we're seeing the decrease in both California and other states. And then finally, you mentioned what's going on with growth and the economy. With the unemployment rate hovering at around 3.5%, That's very positive for workers' compensation. The upward shift in employment levels and wages that we're seeing are impacting our policies to a somewhat greater extent than average. And that is just sort of the flip side of what we saw going into COVID, where we were impacted more negatively as the economy deteriorated. So we're still seeing strong wages in the leisure and hospitality sector. And the momentum is resulting in some strong audit pickups and endorsement activity. So I'll stop there and see if you have any more questions.","Kathy provided an overview of the current accident year loss ratio, noting a slight improvement influenced by pricing trends, particularly in California, where premium rates have increased due to refined pricing methodologies.

So somebody working more hours or more employees being added. So true kind of exposure versus an employee getting paid more for the same exposure.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Maybe, I know it's not your biggest business, but there certainly has been a lot of discussion in the financial community about your Medicare Advantage business. Enrollment looks like you're targeting sort of, you know, mid-7 to 8% or so for the year. Is that fully reflective of what you've got the full view of open enrollment at this point? So you think from here it's just agents largely? And what are you seeing as you drill down in that demographic of the types of members you've attracted in the open enrollment? And then just also I think the comment on the third quarter was that the Medicare Advantage margin in 25 might step up modestly but still be below your long-term targets for Medicare Advantage. Is that still your thinking?","Well, thank you, AJ. Just a few comments. First, we feel very good about and confident in the enrollment guidance that we gave for Medicare Advantage. It did come in line with the expectations that we set, and we had very strong member retention, which we think is a huge positive for us. So overall, I'll ask Felicia to maybe give you a little bit more detail about it, but really good in terms of the positioning of product and geography and overall. And we do think that's where we'll end the year. So Felicia, maybe a little bit more guidance on that. Good morning, A.J., and thank you for the question. You know, as Gail said, we are very pleased with the outcome of our annual enrollment period. Performance was really aligned with our expectations, driven predominantly by strong member retention and really stability in our offerings amid significant disruptions in the market this year. The enrollment trends that we saw in our core markets really reflect the value that seniors place on our balanced approach, and we were very focused on our local strategy to ensure that we were effectively capturing growth opportunities where they were most favorable for us. We are very pleased with the product and the geographic composition of our growth. We saw very strong HMO growth by design and less PPO growth. in the markets that we were looking for that growth. So with AEP results in hand right now, we are confident around our 2025 Medicare Advantage guidance of 7% to 9%, which from a member growth perspective is right in line with our expectations that we provided last year. We're obviously going to continue to be very vigilant around how we manage growth throughout the rest of the year You said there will be predominantly agents and some individuals that come in as a result of dual eligibility, but we are confident in the actions and strategies that we have to maintain growth within the guide that we've provided. Thank you. And then, AJ, on your margin question, we are positioned well to achieve a margin stability in 2025 through many of the factors that Felicia mentioned, including discipline, cost management, and strong retention.","The company is confident in its Medicare Advantage enrollment guidance of 7-9% for 2025, attributing strong member retention and effective local strategies as key factors for growth.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"Could you talk a little bit about what you were seeing in terms of utilization? In particular, perhaps you could talk to what you're seeing in trends by product, like MA and commercial, and how you're thinking about that in terms of your assumptions for 25, and if you can give any commentary on categories of medical cost trend as far as like inpatient, outpatient, et cetera. That'd be great.","Lon, thanks very much for the question this morning. Cost trend in the fourth quarter developed largely as we anticipated, with stability, I would say, across, you know, our lines of business. Specifically, Medicaid, you know, trends remained elevated. They were stable. particularly as we've called out in prior quarters in behavioral health and inpatient services. And we think it's primarily because the ongoing impact of the membership mix changes following redeterminations is really stabilized at this point. In Medicare, cost trends similarly in the fourth quarter were elevated. They were manageable. We saw notable drivers here, including some of the post-acute care services. Again, very consistent with prior expectations and the way that we've priced our bids for 2025. On the commercial side, I would say performance remains strong in line with the disciplined pricing approach that we've adopted to date. And so as we think about 2025, you know, we do expect these elevated trends really to persist in the first half of the year, particularly in Medicaid. On the Medicare side, you know, they're similarly expected to remain stable at the current level. And so I would say our outlook for 2025 really incorporates these dynamics. We're taking a prudent approach to guidance to ensure, again, we deliver sustainable long-term value.","The response indicates that cost trends in the fourth quarter were stable across various lines of business, with elevated trends in Medicaid and Medicare primarily due to changes in membership and post-acute care services.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"You mentioned that Medicaid is an influencer of the higher year-over-year MLR that you're expecting in 2025. I think your previous expectations you discussed last quarter, you know, were for something more stable than that. And it sounds like potentially, you know, the conversation around one-one rates has been, you know, pretty constructive. But I'd love to just get a better sense of what explicitly you're embedding for Medicaid full-year MLR change in this guidance.","Stephen, thanks very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the fourth quarter Medicaid trend in a little bit more detail. So in the fourth quarter, you know, Medicaid cost trends developed in line with the expectations we communicated during October. So specifically, trends generally remained consistent with the elevated levels we observed in September. And again, that reflects just the stabilization of our membership base, you know, given, again, redeterminations materially completed. As we look forward to 2025, we expect these higher than typical Medicaid cost trends, particularly, as I mentioned a moment ago, in behavioral health and inpatient care, really to persist into the first half of 2025. And why does that matter? Well, it matters because current rates have not yet fully caught up to these cost trends. And so we're maintaining a prudent stance on how quickly the Medicaid margins are going to rebound in 2025. And this simply reflects, you know, both the elevated level of cost trend we expect to continue in the first half but also the incremental rate adjustments that we're working on with our state partners. And so you could think about Medicaid as really being a tale of two halves, stabilization in the early part of the year, followed by improvement in the second half of the year as rate adjustments begin to more fully reflect the heightened cost pressures.","The question inquires about the expected Medicaid Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) changes for 2025, particularly in light of recent trends.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"I just really want to understand two things. First would be the comments around the Part D redesign. Mark, can you talk about the specific impact MLR? And then secondly, just understanding that the performance in Carillon RX going into 2025, you talk about mid-teens growth. Can you talk about how much of that is organic, the investments that you're making when we think about the margin improvement that you're talking about for 2025?","Thank you, Lisa. I'm going to have Mark address your first part of your question. Then I'll ask Pete to talk about the growth, which we are really pleased with and excited about what the strategies and execution Carolyn has. So Mark, please. Lisa, thanks very much for the question this morning. So for 25, we're guiding to an MLR of 89.1%. That's approximately 60 bps higher than the prior year at the midpoint. There are three primary factors that are driving the increase here. First is the impact of our strategic growth mix in Medicare, including the Part D changes. Second one is recent acquisitions. And then third is really a prudent view towards medical cost trends. So specifically, you know, the business mix changes are really driven by Cambridge running in the 20-ish basis point range. And that's expected to run at a higher MLR than our organic businesses, as well as stronger relative growth in our Medicare businesses, inclusive of, to your point, the changes in the Part D benefit structure, which has increased the direct subsidy. In addition, I'd say the MLR guidance does reflect elevated but stable cost trends that you heard us talk about a couple of minutes ago, because we're operating in a more dynamic cost environment than historical norms. Pete, maybe share your thoughts on Caroline. Yeah, I appreciate it. And thanks for the question. I'll talk broadly about Caroline. We're really excited about what's going on in Caroline and the growth opportunities. We came off a very, very strong 24, as I think you saw in terms of our growth. We had another strong quarter of growth and very balanced with respect to internal versus external growth. We continue to expand a lot of our risk arrangements internally across oncology, across behavioral health, post-acute solutions. And then externally last year, we have one of our best years ever in terms of external growth, doing about 4x in terms of revenue growth versus 23. And by the way, one of the other key points that we've talked about historically, we're seeing really nice penetration as it relates to the Blues. That momentum will continue into 2025. You'll see very significant growth in our services part of the business with over 50% growth. As Mark mentioned, we're excited about the addition of CareBridge. That certainly adds to it. But then importantly, even outside of CareBridge, our organic growth, both internal and external, on the services side is well above 20%. So very pleased with that. I think you also referenced RX, Lisa, and I feel very good about our story in RX and how our growth story is resonating in the marketplace. Momentum really does continue to build. We're working very closely with Morgan and the commercial team. And one of the things that I'll say that's really resonating in the marketplace, and it's actually enabled us to win some large accounts up market and national account, is This real focus on high touch customer service and advocacy. We are really doubling down on the patient experience and","The question seeks clarification on the impact of Part D redesign on the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) and the organic growth of Carillon RX for 2025.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"So in the slide deck, you're reiterating your expectation of 12% earnings growth from 22 to 27. which off that 22 base would suggest you get something like $51.27. But you're also saying off of the new base this year, you'll grow 5% next year, which would give you something like 34, 65, something in the high 34s. I guess the question is, and it sounds like all of the short-term issues are around Medicaid, is getting the right rates going to be sufficient to get you the kind of accelerated earnings growth in 26 and 27 that would get you back on track to hit that multi-year 12 percent CAGR target, or should we rebase that given what we're looking at in 24 and 25?","Thank you for the question, A.J. Let me provide a little bit of high-level perspective around that because I think you have a lot of math in that question, but I think it's important Certainly appreciate the dynamic environment that we're currently operating in, I think, to really start that first. We believe that the earnings power of our diverse and complimentary businesses remain strong so feel good about thinking about at least 12% over the long term and adjusted EPS over time, so I think that's important. As you heard and we're thinking about what's happening in our business right now. I'd like to sort of reiterate some of the things that Mark shared in his opening comments. First, strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term algorithm in the high single-digit percentage. So there's a lot, I think, to be excited about in our business. Momentum in our commercial business going strong. We're entering several additional expanded ACA footprints next year. We feel good about the Medicare Advantage business, which we focus to be sustainable long-term growth. And Caroline's going to deliver even greater value as we look at the internal and external growth we're seeing in services and the robust pipeline in Caroline Rx. And then the last piece of that is continuing to realize substantial operational efficiencies. However, given, you know, the dynamics that we spoke about in the environment that we're in, we anticipate that Medicaid margins in 25 are going to remain belong our long-term target. But again, this is a timing disconnect between rates and acuity, which we do believe is time bound, but think that can persist through 2025. And also it's really important that we are going to continue to make ongoing investments in 25, because we think that there's a powerful opportunity across our business. So taken together, we think that we're being prudent in how we think about 25, uh, and our expectations at this pace and timing, um, and that our guidance will give you a lot more detail in the fourth quarter. But I think you can rest assured we're going to continue to navigate 25 with the same focus and discipline that has been central to our long-term success. Next question.","The question addresses concerns about achieving a 12% earnings growth target amid short-term challenges related to Medicaid rates.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Just want to come back to the Medicaid discussion. Obviously, the magnitude of the revision that's implied there is alarming, you know, particularly given that we're at the end of the membership impacts from redetermination. just trying to understand better how things got so much worse so quickly. I guess how much of this is actually new to the third quarter versus not having a good reading on where things were last quarter? And to the extent there are new developments in the third quarter, can you better help us understand, you know, perhaps what some of those are?","Thank you. Steven, good morning. Let me start off by noting that we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid. throughout the third quarter. And additionally, we saw unfavorable prior period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business. If I sit back for a moment, the Medicaid cost trends accelerated in the quarter. They restated negatively for the current year. And as such, we're tracking in the range of around three and a half, three to five times the historical average, depending on the state. The elevated level of cost trend is driven and you heard us address this in our prepared remarks, primarily by the higher overall membership acuity given the redetermination cycle is now substantially complete. And we are continuing to work with the states. We very much appreciate their collaboration. And while rate increases to date have also been higher than the historical average, they remain insufficient to fully cover the claims trends that we're seeing. And so it's important to keep in mind that the state processes themselves typically rely on reference periods that lag current experience by as much as one to two years. And while we are sharing more recent experience and trend information real time with the states, it's going to take time before that's fully reflected in their rate schedule. Thank you. Next question, please.","The question addresses concerns about alarming Medicaid cost trends and seeks clarification on whether recent developments contributed to worsening conditions in the third quarter.

It's just the are there any pockets of areas where where you see a large bullets of members come off acuity increase and then have a state renegotiation? that could be kind of a catalyst for creating some accelerated recovery? Or how do you think about pacing of the recovery throughout next year?","Yeah, thanks for the question, Ben. I'll ask Mark to comment on this as well. But I remember this is one of the largest and unprecedented NIC shifts we've seen in Medicaid as the PHE has unwound over the course of the year. And again, as Mark said, what we saw was this acceleration through the third quarter. So I think Putting that in perspective is really important. We have not had an environment like this before in Medicaid, so it's a very unusual timeframe for us. But let me have Mark give a little bit more color on that. Ben, I think the only thing I'll add to Gail's remarks is that as we think about 2025, we do expect that mismatch between rates and acuity to narrow, especially as the state rate updates increasingly reflect the underlying member acuity.

It was manageable overall, reflected some incremental pressure related to the two-midnight rule. We also saw a late summer surge in COVID.

What's your thought about ability to get back to that growth trajectory that you're seeking long term in 25?,"Great. Thanks, AJ, and thanks very much for the question this morning. You know, I think, let me start with what Mark outlined as our enterprise growth algorithm, because I think that really frames for everyone how we are thinking about our business. And also, as you think about 2024 and our results, the balance and resilience of our complementary businesses that has allowed us to grow in multiple ways in many type of different macroeconomic environments. While it is early for 25, I'd like to at least frame sort of how we're thinking about 2025. We do expect to accelerate revenue growth across all of our businesses. Specifically in our health business, we see a lot of really strong momentum in commercial, and that's been ongoing. Part of that's through the targeted expansion of our individual ACA footprint, and in some cases, adding new geographies that help support what's happening in the Medicaid redeterminations. The Medicare Advantage, as we said in our opening comments, We feel that we've positioned ourselves for sustainable growth and margins and look at that as a very good long-term business. And in Medicaid, we're nearing the end of the redetermination cycle, and we do anticipate a return to growth. And you've heard about some of our early wins this year, which we are very pleased with. We also do believe that some of those that were redetermined based on administrative reasons will be coming back, albeit it's taken a little bit longer than we originally thought. And then I'd like to kind of close these comments about our excitement around Carillon and the growth that we're seeing and how we've progressed. You saw some of that come through in the second quarter. In Carillon services, we are seeing some very strong external growth in the quarter, and we see expanded opportunities as we continue to build our capabilities, particularly in the risk market. And what we're seeing here is our ability to prove it on our own businesses first and then take it to the market commercially has been a really strong selling point for us, and we're very excited about that. And then finally, Carol on Rx is our ability to scale, especially on the specialty side, including the integration of some of our recent capabilities, such as Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and we're looking forward to adding the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business as well as we continue to diversify. So overall, as we think about acceleration of revenue growth in 25, we do expect it across all of our business and are extremely positive about what we're seeing inside of our business.

Thanks for the questions, Nathan. A lot in there. So let me ask Felicia Narwood, who leads government first, and then have Mark respond to the second part of your question. Felicia? So good morning, Nathan. You know, you are absolutely right. The way our rate timing works, we have about half of our states where we have rates in the first half of the year and the other half in the back half of the year with a core group certainly in fourth quarter. At this point, you know, we have visibility into nearly all of our Medicaid premium for 2024, and the rate conversations with our states are very constructive. With that said, not all of our rates are final. We are in constant conversations with our states and providing them with information, updated information that we see in terms of the experience almost weekly to make sure that they are seeing what we are seeing from an overall change perspective as we wind down redeterminations, which certainly has been one of the largest transformative things that have happened in Medicaid for some period of time. I will say that the conversations are ongoing. We fully expect our rates to remain actuarially sound, though we acknowledge the potential for a short-term disconnect between the timing of our rates and the emerging acuity in our populations, and that's certainly been reflected in our updates for the year. I will say that we continue to make sure that states and their actuaries have the most recent data that we have, and we will continue to have that engagement as we go through the four-quarter rate process with a few very large states that remain in negotiations with us. And with that, I will turn it over to Mark to talk about the rest of the issues around utilization. Thanks very much, Felicia, and good morning. Medicaid utilization in the quarter, as you heard from Felicia, reflected higher acuity as expected. We are also seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures. I just wanted to add here, just as we noted in our prepared remarks, the full year outlook does allow for both this shift in acuity and increased utilization in the second half of the year, including the rate timing mismatch that Felicia spoke to. Thank you.","The question inquired about Medicaid rate updates and the relationship between state rates and patient acuity.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q2 2024,Financial Services,"Could you talk a little bit about Caroline Rx, and in particular, interested in the contracting approach and scope for the CVS contract that underlies parts of that as you're insourcing things. And then just if you could give a quick update on the status of the integration rollout to the AMPA members and other members of BioPlus and Paragon and the status of Kroger.","Great. Well, thanks, Lance. I'm going to have Pete Hightine, who leads Caroline, to address your question. Yeah, thanks a lot for the question, Lance. We feel very good about the overall strategy as it relates to pharmacy. I'll start with, you know, how we're performing on the core and growth in the core. Our strategy is resonating in the marketplace. There continues to be a lot of interest in what we're doing as it relates to the strategic levers that matter and how we're insourcing and diversifying our business. And I think our value story is really resonating, the integrated value story. And that's really playing through with highly competitive pricing. And again, we continue to perform very well on the core PBM down market and middle market. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to our diversification and your question You know, on our assets, things are going, you know, very well. Um, as we talked about with regard to specialty, we spent the last year building out our infrastructure to be able to handle, um, the capacity to have the capacity to handle the elephant scripts. And we feel very good about that. We began to migrate scripts at the beginning of this year as it relates to specialty. And we continue to move forward in that regard. And importantly, um, we are preparing right now and continue to make investments. around the Kroger close and assuming those scripts as well. Right now, we're projecting that to close Q3, Q4 this year. And again, a lot of preparation and investment to make sure that we do that really well. And then finally, as it relates to Paragon, again, just to reiterate the opportunity there, because we feel very, very good about that. We're talking about $16 billion of infusion spend as it relates to Elevance Health. with about 50% of that being in the hospital setting. So again, a great opportunity for us to have care be provided in a more appropriate setting, be it in an ambulatory site or in the home. And we feel very good about our positioning and the density that we have in our markets as it relates to that. And importantly, as part of that strategy, we are targeting at a zip code level the standup of ambulatory sites to be able to provide that care. We're launching one imminently, and then we are preparing and building out strategies to launch others into 2025. So overall, we feel very good about our strategy of insourcing the strategic levers that matter and the growth opportunity that exists. Thanks, Pete. And thanks again, Lance, for the question. And just I think this is a great example of our flywheel for growth and our ability to scale these assets, which we're very excited about. And again, thinking about this as the opportunity to drive a differentiated cost of care for our health plans within Elevance Health. but also better experience for members and support our partners across the ecosystem. So, again, a really important part of our flywheel.","The question inquired about Caroline Rx's contracting approach, particularly regarding CVS, and the integration status of AMPA members and Kroger.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Let me ask a little bit about the value-based care strategy and the execution. That's obviously a really big step forward. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the vision and scope of this? Is this going to be more focused on enablement, or in particular markets, is practice ownership going to be important? And maybe if you can kind of color in the picture a little bit as far as leadership, names, which Carolina assets are going to be contributed, and near term, do you see which areas of leverage across the membership base of Elevents do you see this being able to penetrate most effectively?","Well, great. Thanks so much for the question, Lance. First, as I shared on in my opening comments, we're very excited about this partnership with CDNR because it is very much the next step in our journey to bring value-based care to more consumers, specifically about partnering closely with care providers. And we see it as absolutely consistent, driving greater risk adoption and advancing our specialty enablement strategy as well. So it's very much a first step there. And as you said in your question, this aligns very closely with our strategy and our broad partnership focus to work directly with care providers in our local markets. And our goal again remains to increase more downside risk sharing in our value-based arrangements. I think, you know, to take a step back, what makes this approach unique is that we're enabling value-based care across all lines of business. So as I shared, the combined company is going to be pair agnostic. And it's focused on enabling advanced primary care locally. And from the get-go, it's going to serve nearly 1 million consumers. And that's going to be across our commercial Medicare and Medicaid health plans upon formation. Another thing I think is important is that it provides the opportunity to pull through Carol and services to support those patients and accelerate that specialty enablement for complex and chronic patients. We have been working with these management teams and these assets for some time. and feel very confident about the alignment of our goals to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner. The goal gets back again to focusing on whole health, the needs of consumers, driving greater affordability, and fundamentally differentiate a consumer experience. A few things about the partnership too, and again, what makes it different for patients. They're going to have access to integrated teams. We're looking at personalized navigation, expanded digital assets, and specialized services. The primary care model is going to be built to be very distinctive, including community practices purpose built clinics high risk clinics and digitally enabled care model. So she can see it's a fairly comprehensive approach. And the last thing I'd say is that employers in market have not historically had access to a lot of these capabilities and we have seen through the work that we're already doing. that this dedicated primary care capacity that integrates the clinical and benefits navigation with their specific health and wellness strategies is truly differentiating. So again, this is being purpose-built to work across all of the aspects of Medicare, Medicare commercial, not just a single business. So very much excited. We see this as an opportunity to accelerate innovation in the space and improve healthcare outcomes and consumer experiences. So thanks very much for the question.","The value-based care strategy aims to enhance partnerships with care providers and increase risk sharing across various health plans, serving nearly 1 million consumers.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"I appreciate Mark's comments about the buildup a little bit in days less payable, but just maybe to flesh out a little bit more the impact of the change cyber attack on results. Do you have a sense as to what percentage of your claims that you normally see in the first quarter may still be out there? Do you feel like you've got a good handle on that? And anything when you address that in terms of your normal IBNR and maybe you've got a significantly higher level of IBNR because you're allowing for the change and if you can break out what you're actually seeing a little bit on cost trends versus needing to sort of provision for the unknowns of the change cyber attack.","Thanks for the question, AJ. Let me maybe provide some broad-based comments, and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more specificity on your questions. Now, I want to say, first and foremost, I'm really proud of our teams and how they responded to this issue that occurred with change quickly and effectively, first to protect our members and their data, and also help our care providers maintain their operations and cash flow. Importantly, I think it's important to note that from a perspective, we were not as significantly impacted by this, and we are back to normal operations in terms of claims flow. Importantly, another thing that's really important to understand is our prior authorization provider payments and pharmacy claims were not materially impacted as well because they don't go through change. We don't use change significantly for those. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more comments, but I think framing it overall, we feel that our teams acted quite quickly and really proud of our ability to work in the ecosystem to help support them.  Hey, Jay, as you just heard from Gail, we acted quite responsibly to save our network connections to change healthcare and to protect the data of both our members and providers. While we initially observed a 15 to 20% reduction in the daily volume of electronic data receipts from providers, most of which were claims related, in recent weeks, our extensive efforts have led to a significant catch up in outstanding claim volumes. And for the quarter, we are effectively caught up on claims receipts and are now working to complete all necessary claims adjudication and processing activities. As such, as part of the normal reserving practices, we've reflected the appropriate impact of the industry-wide disruption related to change healthcare in the reserves we've reported for our first quarter financials. And that ensures both consistency with historical practice and prudence. And then to your specific question, the impact here was to increase our sequential days and claims payable quarterly results by approximately 1.7 days. Thank you.","The question inquires about the impact of a cyber attack on claims and reserves, specifically regarding the percentage of outstanding claims and the company's handling of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"I wanted to get back to the partnership with CDNR, and specifically, what alternatives did you evaluate and consider before coming to this arrangement? I think in the past, you were stressing more, and I've heard it today as well, that focus on specialty care. So how does that fit in and sort of get bolted on on top of this? And maybe where does this fit into your longer-term national approach? And then How important was it that you could serve multiple memberships and not just Medicare Advantage?","Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh, because I think it very much aligns to the strategy that we've laid out. I guess first and foremost, it's pair agnostic, and it was really important. We've always said that our goal, given the diversity of our business mix, is to serve all members across all business lines. Given the depth and density of our membership in our local markets, that is very important. We had a partnership already working with many of these assets. So as I said, we know the leadership teams, we know the value that can be created. And so we have been working with them and feel quite good about what we can create. This is pair agnostic, which we also think is very important. And again, this will help us continue through having a focus on advanced primary care. It's still very much focused on our chronic patients and complex patients, and we are still building specialty care enablement, which is, again, another very important component of what we're trying to probe through. So I think from that value-based care across all lines of business, a critical part of our strategy, very consistent, driving value-based care, continuing to drive much more downside risk, which means that we needed strong enablement capabilities to help practices work their way through that. We know that it takes time. It is also a technology-driven model. So one of the nice things about this partnership is that there are embedded technology assets to digitally enable care as well. And then we have a focus on patient access and experience in the adoption of next-generation models. So again, consistent with the strategy that we've had over the last several years, not really a diversion, I think, from that. And I think the timing for us was right because we have been experimenting with multiple models and have a lot of experience in the space right now. So, thank you very much for the question.","The speaker emphasized that the partnership with CDNR is designed to be pair agnostic, aiming to serve diverse members across all business lines while focusing on advanced primary care and specialty care.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Just another question on the CDNR partnership. To what extent are these primary care platforms taking risk currently? Is that something that we will need to see develop as we kind of get more of these digital enablement abilities from Caroline? Just wanted to see if over the five-year horizon to full ownership, if we can expect to kind of get the full capitation in those platforms, you know, over that time period.","Thanks, Ben. I'm going to have Pete probably provide a lot more context, but just quickly, about a third of the membership is under a risk arrangement now. With that, Pete, why don't you give a little more color into the relationship and how we see it evolve?  That's great. Thanks for the question, Ben. And I'll give you a little bit more color on the assets and the capabilities. They really all have their distinct strengths. We see great opportunities, quite frankly, to cross-pollinate. When you think about MPG, to your question on risk, they really are a leader in managing Medicare and commercial risk. And they've also got a very strong chassis. I think for future growth and a proven model in that regard in terms of acquiring provider practices. So very strong at managing risk and a lot of capabilities in that regard.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2023,Financial Services,"I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning. With 2025, you'll have the star ratings impact to overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears, at least on the surface, to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that star ratings impact? Will you step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carillon? How do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year?","Well, thanks for the question, AJ. There's a lot in there, and as you know, 25, it's a little early to apply on 25, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with star ratings, though, because as we shared on the last call, we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and We're strategically committed to the long term, and I will reiterate this year we felt we took very prudent actions for a long term sustainable business and feel good about our bids. So that positions us well for 2025 in particular. In terms of the star ratings, again, few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall star ratings, we do think that that's going to be a multi-year initiative, but I wanted to share, as I shared on my early remarks that we, um, we have invested at the last part of the year and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement. We have been successful at moving all of our business into our health advocate model. And we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the cut points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, feel really good about where our bids have come out. Let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 25 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and STARS. And, you know, as I think about 25, again, not giving guidance on 25, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025. And we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is an improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carillon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in 25 after a reset year in 24. And we should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carillon. And then Carillon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities and will share, I assume, even more of those on the call today. And then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our discipline operating cost efficiencies. And we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits and Caroline together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much for the question. And next question, please.","The question inquires about the company's strategy for addressing potential challenges related to star ratings in 2025 and whether it will adjust its financial tactics, such as share repurchases or investments.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2023,Financial Services,"I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, you're repositioning commercial, and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully. But why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement. Is there some offset? you know, in there?","Good morning, and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023 just to set the context here. So our 2023 benefit expense ratio end of the year is slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year over year, as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range. As it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87% plus minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, you know, the health benefits, benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q4 2023,Financial Services,"I was wondering if we could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations, and I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that, and then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year.","Well, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple overarching comments, because I think it's important that I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming. So I think you have to take that into account. But she'll She'll just provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So, Felicia, please.  Sure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. You know, as we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. You know, in the mainland, we exited a scale noted specifically certain markets that had been underperforming for us for years. And with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive, sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the three-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico. Now, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long-term, sustainably, and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us, as we expected. When we exclude the planned attrition on the mainland that I mentioned earlier, Our Net Mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single digits this year, despite encountering greater disenrollment in certain markets due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward, and we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our blue markets. We are performing better in our blue markets than the overall growth rates. And we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin and membership growth. So we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, would expect to have flat membership in 2024. Thank you.

In terms of answering your question specifically, though, We're certainly obviously very pleased with the performance of our health benefits businesses in the third quarter as well as year to date. As you know, we've increased margins quite significantly.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,"I wanted to ask on the Medicare business, could you talk about the goal for improving star scores? Are you investing to get back to the level that you are at with 65% of members in four-star plans? Over what period are you thinking? How should we think about the magnitude of the incremental investments plan for the fourth quarter as well as into next year? And any comment on the kind of how long it would take to reach the run rate of optimization savings, the $750 million that you talked about, would be helpful as well. Thank you.","Thanks for the question, Nathan. I anticipate a number of questions around stars, so perhaps I'll just address that topic holistically. You know, improving stars for us is an enterprise priority, so I want to start with that. And we have a long-term commitment to the MA business. and are committed to offering high-quality plans for seniors. But as I said in my opening comments, we're extremely disappointed on the recent results of the stars and the decline that we saw in the number of our members in four-star plans for payment year 25. Just a little background I think might help. We experienced some declines in the CAHPS survey scores, which were the most heavily weighted measures, and we were also impacted by that new CMS statistical methodology, which caused some significant increases in cut points. You know, as you think about our performance, we improved in about half of the star measures, but those were not enough to offset the impact of the heavily weighted measures and the higher cut points, therefore having three of our largest contracts suffered in our star ratings, which you've noted. As I shared, we have already started making those investments, and earlier this year, we were specifically addressing areas around the heightened focus for caps that drove the decline. One of the very specific examples is scaling the My Health Advocate model, which, again, I shared a little bit about that in my opening remarks. The model is unique and highly personalized customer service, and it's tailored specifically to help members with problems central to CAHPS improvement. It's a model that we've had in place in our commercial business and has been incredibly successful. Other areas that we saw in the data were about enhancing our core and supplemental benefits. to reduce members' out-of-pocket costs, which showed up in our STARS results, and also simplifying how those members use our over-the-counter benefits. We've gone on a journey around value-based care, as we've shared with you, and we're going to continue to accelerate that and embed some of those results as well into our contracting process. And we also took steps last year to improve the processes around clinical decision appeals, which was also an area around the higher cut points. In terms of financial impact, we expect a reduction in 2025 quality bonus revenue of approximately $500 million after offsets from our contracting provisions. As John and I both shared, we've already aggressively begun to mitigate that headwind for 2025, and we do have a number of levels at our disposal, including contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment, and looking at targeted network and product enhancements. Overall, we're going to continue to work on that our timelines have already begun on this feel we have a very, very good line of sight to the opportunities that we have. And again, because of the diversified business model that we've talked to you about, we feel that the earnings power of our combined businesses between health benefits and Caroline allow us to continue to feel comfortable about our adjusted earnings for share growth annually of 12 to 15% over the long term. So thanks again for the question. Appreciate the opportunity to holistically address what we're doing about STARS. Next question, please.","The question inquired about the company's goals for improving Medicare star scores, investment plans to regain a majority of members in four-star plans, and the timeline for achieving optimization savings.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"I appreciate the good performance on the medical loss ratio line and that you're benefiting from your repricing in the commercial book, which you've been talking about for a while. You didn't really call out anything as deviating from your underlying expectations relative to Medicare Advantage, commercial, or Medicaid. I just wondered if you would maybe flesh that out a little more. Are you seeing any trend changes or anything on the horizon? And how did you think about the MA bids in light of anything you saw there on the utilization front?","Thank you for the kind words, AJ, and good morning, everyone. And I really do appreciate the question and the opportunity to provide clarity on these issues. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which is really following delivery of strong results also in the first quarter. And related to your question and the issues on trend, I do think part of the confusion out there is trying to understand what is happening versus what is expected. or what was expected. You know, we've noted previously, you know, when you combine COVID and non-COVID costs, the overall cost of the healthcare system is more expensive than if COVID had never occurred. Something we've been talking about and analyzing and stating for a while now. So given that fact, we had already included the elevated cost structure into our pricing into our projections and into our guidance. And quite honestly, this is true for all lines of business within the health benefit segment. So if you look at the first and second quarter in particular, there really isn't anything all that surprising or all that different from our overall expectations. Costs continue to be higher than compared to a baseline as if COVID never existed. You know, so we obviously were very well positioned. And as you know, based on this morning's call, we raised our guidance by $0.15 to $32.85 per share. And those expectations fall solidly within our 12% to 15% compound annual long-term growth rate target. But I think just as importantly, as you heard in my prepared comments, we reaffirmed our original guidance for the full year 2023 benefit expense ratio. Anyway, thanks for the question, AJ and operator. Next question, please.","The question inquired about potential trend changes in Medicare Advantage, commercial, and Medicaid sectors, as well as the impact of utilization on MA bids.

I'm going to have Pete, I tie in and address it, but I think you hit a couple of key areas around Carol on both services and Rx where we feel that we're advancing the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day and feel really good about the progress. So, Pete, why don't you talk about both of those areas? Yeah, no, thanks, Gail, and thanks, Lance. I really appreciate the question. And you know this. We've talked a lot about it, but a big part of our strategy is obviously to focus on managing high-cost, high-trend areas. Gail talked about it today in her prepared remarks. And then, obviously, capitating risk down to through Elevance, you know, with Elevance Health first in mind. We are, part of our strategy was to drive that value through Elevance Health first and then have that translate externally. And we are seeing that play through very, very nicely. So I'll give you a sense of, you know, quickly what's happening internally and then Lance, to your question, how that translates externally. Internally, we're working very closely with the P&Ls and we continue to accelerate a lot of opportunity. We talked about finalizing the post-acute care initiative this year. That's over 1.2 million Medicare members. We just launched a new durable medical equipment offering. as well with our Medicare business, and we're expanding that to commercial. And in our medical benefits management, which was formerly AIM, we've insourced a lot of critical services around genetic testing and things like oncology, so a lot of energy around that. And then, of course, the behavioral health, physical health opportunity and assuming full risk on that is a tremendous opportunity as well. And interestingly enough, where we're having a lot of success internally, that is actually translating in our external pipeline. and specifically with the Blues. As we talk about the Blues and they see us having a lot of confidence and good performance internally in Elevance, they're interested in some of those same solutions. So I would say at the top of the list, when you look at our pipeline and the growth in our pipeline, the home solutions through MyNexus, now called Carillon Post Acute Care Solutions, is getting a lot of visibility. The post acute care offering that we just launched in our Medicare business internally, is also driving a lot of excitement in the pipeline. And I would also say that there's a decent amount of interest in some of the innovations around payment integrity. So I think a lot of opportunity, not only still internally, but that will translate as it relates to the Blues. As it relates to advanced home delivery and the launch of Carillon Rx Pharmacy, that was the second part of your question. Again, really, really excited about this initiative. And as we've talked about overall for our pharmacy strategy, it's to insource the strategic levers that really matter. And we're doing that both with obviously what we're doing in specialty and in insourcing this activity. But I wouldn't look at this as only insourcing mail. I would look at it more broadly in terms of what we're trying to do to get closer to the member and differentiate in terms of our experience overall with our consumers. Think of the capabilities that we're deploying. Number one, this is going to be connected to Sydney, our consumer engagement platform. There's going to be a convenient quick scheduling of medications. If you think about access to pharmacists and how critical that is, we're going to have access to a pharmacist 24-7, so that's a big differentiator. And then, importantly, I think a lot of people know that the experience with mail isn't necessarily always smooth. And so we're going to have an easy view of where delivery stands, an Uber-like experience, quite frankly, so you know where your pharmaceuticals stand in terms of their delivery. So a lot in that regard in terms of really differentiating ourselves on experience, and we're excited about that. And as Gail said, we're ready to launch that headed into 2024. Yeah, thank you, Pete. As you can hear from the excitement, I think, from Pete and all the things we're doing at both Carillon Services and Carillon Rx, There's a lot going on to really build our strategy and I think execute on it. And I guess I would just punctuate two things that Pete talked about. One, the behavioral health area. We really see ourselves as a leader in the crisis management area, as well as we're seeing a lot of internal or external validity of that strategy. And I think starting to pull through not just in its historic government business, but also in the commercial side where they're integrating physical and behavioral in particular, which is a core part of our whole health strategy. And then on the pharmacy side, again, we're really trying to make sure that the value and strategic levers are coming through, and you heard that in what Pete talked about. So thanks for the question, Lance. And next question, please.","The discussion focuses on Carillon's strategic advancements in managing high-cost healthcare areas and enhancing pharmacy capabilities, particularly through their new Carillon Rx Pharmacy and home delivery services.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q2 2023,Financial Services,"First, just wanted to follow up on AJ's question, just seeing if you can give us a little color. You're saying trend is above normal and you priced for it. We appreciate that color. Just any kind of incremental that you can give us on how much higher and what you've seen, one Q to two Q might be helpful. And then my question is just take that to the margin side. Can you tell us how margins are running versus the expectations coming into the year? I know you had expected improvement in Medicare and commercial and obviously some volatility in Medicaid. Can you tell us how those are running and specifically anything on Medicare beyond Puerto Rico issues you had discussed in the second quarter would be helpful? Thanks. Or how that's trending.","Yeah, thank you for the question, Justin, and I'm happy to provide the follow-up. You know, As I said, I'll start out by reiterating we did raise our EPS guidance and proactively reaffirmed MOR guidance for the year. So I think that actually has a forward view of trend inherent in it. But having said that, I'm not so sure that we're really seeing anything that much differently than some other folks have been saying. We've been expecting the cost of health care to be elevated compared to the baseline as if COVID never existed. I'm not going to provide a specific point estimate, but Only to say that we've seen it, we've priced for it, and we've included and factored it into our expectations. And this is the second time this year we've raised guidance and reaffirming the MLR outlook, so I think we're in a pretty good position. Associated with the margins, commercial is doing very well. I'll start out with health benefits in total. That's our health benefits segment. MARGINS APPROVED 50 BASIS POINTS YEAR OVER YEAR AND ARE ON TRACK TO HIT THE GUIDANCE OF GREATER THAN IMPROVEMENT OF 30 TO 60 BASIS POINTS.

"Elevance Health, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"So, John, you talked about seasonality impacts. You talked about different types of claims driving a little bit lower DCP. And then you said low 40s is where we're going. Now, over time, I think everyone and every managed care investor looks at DCP and thinks of it as quality of earnings metric, right? When it's going up, it's good and down, it's bad, right? And typically, you just think that, you know, there's more or less reserving going on. I know there's a lot more to it. So maybe you can tell us, you know, what's been driving your DCP lower recently beyond what you talked about already? And how are we going to get to the low 40s? Meaning, is it going to be through lower reserving or is it going to be through kind of mechanical aspects? And over what time period should we expect that to kind of normalize?","Thank you, Justin. And I do appreciate you taking your question or maybe I should say questions on DCP. But yeah, our DCP is down 1.5 days, quarter over quarter and 0.9 days sequentially. And you know, there's a lot of things that go into that calculation, all the way from the number of days and the denominator can change on a quarter over quarter basis to various other aspects. I'LL JUST STATE AT THE OUTSET THAT OUR DCP WILL NOT GET LOWER BY REDUCING RESERVES. WE HAVE A VERY CONSISTENT AND CONSERVATIVE METHODOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACTUARIAL TEAM IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH RESERVES. THOSE RESERVES ARE CONSISTENT HERE AT MARCH 31ST AS THEY WERE AT DECEMBER 31ST IN THAT THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO THE INCOME STATEMENT. associated with this drop in DCP. So having that behind, maybe talk a little bit about some of the mechanics that you asked about. You know, we have a mix in the type of claims is obviously very important. And you look at a year ago, we were in the midst of the Omicron surge with COVID. COVID claims had a longer cycle time than other claims do. That had been the case through the entirety of the pandemic. And when you have a claim type that takes longer, both for the provider to bill us and for our adjudication process, the cycle time becomes longer. DCP just mathematically becomes a little bit inflated. And so with COVID being so much less in the first quarter of 2023 than it was in 2022 or 2021 for that matter, you know, that cycle time is really very important. And so you see a drop. You know, on reserves, and I made this comment in the prepared statements, but I think it's really important. On the reserves, you know, we have these retrospective provider pass-through payments that we get from our Medicaid partners, Medicaid states. And the amount of those reserves as of March of 23 are $400 million less than they were at the end of March of 22. YOU KNOW, IF WE PULLED OUT FROM THE CALCULATION FROM OUR RESERVES THESE PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS WHICH PASS THROUGH BY DEFINITION HAVE ZERO IMPACT ON NET INCOME, THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT OUR MEDICAL CLAIMS PAYABLE BALANCES HAVE GROWN 10.1% YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARED TO A 9.4% GROWTH IN PREMIUM, FURTHER SHOWING THAT OUR RESERVING METHODOLOGIES ARE CONSERVATIVE AND OUR RESERVES ARE STILL VERY, VERY STRONG. In terms of how long it's going to take to get to the low 40s, it'll be another few years. And, you know, there's any number of constructs that will occur. But, you know, we are starting to see payment cycles more consistent with pre-pandemic era payment cycles. And as those things are fully baked into the numbers, you should expect DCP to tweak down as a result. So thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to clarify all that.","The question addresses the recent decline in Days Claims Payable (DCP) and seeks clarification on its causes and future expectations. The answer explains that the decrease is not due to lower reserves but rather changes in claim types and payment cycles, with a projection that DCP will normalize to the low 40s over the next few years as payment processes stabilize.",0,2,-0.9999995,0.035087719,11,6,0.29411763,0.298245609,3,10,-0.538461497,0.077844311,34,12,0.478260859,0.2754491,1,1,0,2,6,0

You know, we're certainly very comfortable with our MLR guidance and really pleased to report a first quarter medical loss ratio of 85.8%. You know, and maybe reiterating what I stated at Investor Day, you know, the overall cost structure and the overall trends are very much aligned with our expectations, consistent with our pricing methodologies and consistent with our thought process. Now, those trends are slightly elevated from what cost trends were pre pandemic level. But as I said, they're exactly in line with our expectations and exactly aligned with our pricing methodology.

And then just in general, what your product strategy is with respect to self-insured as you're looking at your bundling in of some of your services businesses there.","Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to ask Ward and Kendrick first to talk a little bit about our fee-based business and then probably Pete to share what's happening in Carillon because I think he hit on a really important point. The improvement of services that we're selling through to commercial, it's been a strategy for a number of years, and we've made some nice progress, as you've seen, just in the percentage of premium going up and the profit per member. And then, obviously, Carillon is a big part of that, not just with the PBM, but Carillon Services. So, Morgan, please share. Lance, thanks for the question. You know, when we think about the fee-based business, you know, we've had a really strong run in the past several years. And I think that goes back and speaks to the health and the value that we're driving to the market, especially to the employers who are actually spending their own money. To your point, Carillon is a big, big piece of it. We had a really nice selling cycle this year, in fact, with the pharmacy business. We didn't see very many jumbos in the medical side, so thus that was sort of absent from the actual Rx percentage as well for us. But nonetheless, we're seeing more and more attraction to this idea of the whole integrated delivery model of pharmacy medical together and the value that's delivering. Secondly, you think about the other products that working with Carol on whether it's the behavioral health, whether these are sort of the incentive programs around payment integrity and bill review, things of that nature that are really important to our self-funded customers. That continues to see very strong growth and attraction from the market. That said, at the end of the day, Pete's team and my team are working together to build for purpose things that create value in the market. And again, I'll anchor back to the three things that Gail mentioned in the beginning in her opening remarks. The market is keenly focused on affordability, experience, and simplicity. And the more that we can pull together, the better it's going to be for our markets. And I think the connection here between Carillon and the commercial fee-based business is strategically critical to that continuing to drive growth. Pete, I'll turn it to you. All right. Thanks, Morgan. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'll start with the pharmacy, and then I'll go to the services side of things. As Morgan said, you know, the integrated offerings that we're selling is really resonating in the marketplace. I think our economics are perceived today as being very strong. And we continue to see momentum. We talked about this in the 10,000 or below segment where, you know, Morgan and the business have a lot of strength on the commercial side of the business. We've seen RFP activity, quite frankly, be up in 23 year over year. And another thing that I'll say is that I'm pleased with is retention is improving, you know, overall. So that's a really good thing. We're working closely with Morgan right now on the 24 selling season that has begun. The pipe is building. I would say that we're very interested in niche opportunities, again, where our commercial business has a lot of strength. So for example, on the labor side, as well as with TPAs. So we see continued a lot of opportunity in sort of either niche opportunities or that 10,000 and below. As it relates to services, You know, as Morgan said, we're really building off of where we started, and Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks things like the post-acute care offering. That's a great example of where we started in Medicare, and we're really expanding that now into commercial and expanding it not only for post-acute care services but for things like durable medical equipment as well as social determinants of health. And then in our medical benefits management business, formerly known as AIM, we are insourcing a lot of critical services that we're deploying and cross-selling into Morgan's business, things like genetic","The discussion focused on cross sales in the quarter, particularly regarding pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and self-insured blocks, highlighting the integration of services and strong growth in fee-based business.

Just trying to get a sense as you kind of gauge the macro environment, you know, whether it's just sort of stable and reflecting, you know, the credit actions you've taken over the last couple of years, or if in fact there are any indicators out there that, you know, are some green flags that say, you know what, maybe we will loosen the credit box a little.","Yeah, let me answer that two different ways. Kind of a top-down and bottom-up way of viewing it. I think on the consumer side of our business, we see the consumers that we target, you know, kind of more globally being very strong. We think that segment of the population continues to benefit from a very strong labor market and rising wages. And in that environment, that's a very conducive environment for us. In terms of the overall portfolio, I think we were actually a little light on risk a year ago, and we added a bit of risk during the year, not a ton, and most of it actually in the first half of the year, and then kind of maintained in the second half of the year. So as you kind of play that forward through 2025, I would not expect kind of major changes in the performance of the portfolio. Because as you know, our consumer book is very short-term in nature. So most of that additional risk you would have seen by the end of 2024. So overall, we feel really good about the book that we've already originated, but also the continued health of the kind of non-prime consumer, which makes us feel good about the performance of the book going forward, but also our ability to originate additional loans. On the small business side, I would say if anything, we feel better about the health of small businesses across the country. I think they've had one more year to build strength kind of following the pandemic and following the high inflationary years of kind of 22, early 23. And so we're feeling also very good about kind of the general health of small businesses.","David indicates that the targeted consumer segment remains strong due to a robust labor market and rising wages, suggesting a healthy outlook for loan performance.

But you know, there's businesses that are benefit from the tariffs and businesses that will, you know, get hurt from the tariffs. And we have extremely diversified small business loan book as we discussed before. And so, you know, we largely think that will balance out. There's not any concentrations in our loan books, say, you know, from wholesalers, for example, that would be maybe more nervous about. So yeah, too early to know for sure.

You know, obviously there's been a lot of private credit flowing into the personal loan market in the last 18 months, but that's more of the near prime sort of high teens APR up into the maybe one main, you know, 30% range. Has there been any new private capital flowing into kind of your tier of lines of credit personal loans, your credit tiers?","I mean, we have the same competitors we had five years ago, and you know, I think our growth rate's just been much higher than theirs, and so we're, you know, kind of as relative to their size, we're much bigger than them than we were five years ago, we were already bigger than them. So, you know, we haven't seen it.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"First question is just, just because, you know, maybe we haven't talked about this as much as kind of recently is the mix of new and recurring customers in both portfolios, the small business portfolio and the consumer portfolio. And I know sometimes you've given an update and sometimes you don't, but I'm wondering, you know, has that generally over the past year, has that shifted, and as you look to 25, where do you see the better, well, the better opportunity to contribute to growth? Is it lean into new customers or to harvest the, call it, the recurring customer?","Hey, John. So one reason we don't talk much about the new customer mix anymore is because it's just been remarkably stable for such a long period of time. And it's been, you know, plus or minus around 40% of originations for both portfolios, both consumer and small business for quite some time. So there's really not much to say about it. Like when we were growing back pre-COVID, it was a little different story. When you think about going forward, I think, you know, we'll continue our focus on attracting new customers into our franchise, you know, with our unit economics approach and our efficient marketing approach that we've always taken. And obviously we've built a lot of new customers over the years and we'll be focused on continuing to serve as returning customers. So I don't see a big shift in the new returning customer mix as you look at, you know, over time, plus or minus around 40 is probably what it will be for some time.","The mix of new and recurring customers in both the small business and consumer portfolios has remained stable at around 40% for originations over the past year.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q4 2024,Financial Services,"And then a second question is, Steve, you mentioned some cost of capital savings this year. And I think that's in spite of, you know, I guess, assuming, is it no rate cuts or just one rate cut? And then beyond that, maybe remind us the sensitivity around rates, you know, maybe so for each extra 25 basis point rate reduction, what would that present to potential EPS upside, you know, as it's settled in?","Yeah, well, I was just giving you an example of my commentary that if the Fed did not cut again, 2025 cost of funds would come down about 50 basis points. In our guidance, we've assumed that there's one cut so I think, you know, we're below where the market would think it would be, but we think there's a cut at some point later in 2025.

We didn't really address 2025 specifically in our commentary, but I think our view is we have some momentum as we're obviously with our Q4 guide, we expect some of that momentum to continue. And, you know, barring a change in the operating environment, as you mentioned, or something materially changing, we should be able to continue, you know, our momentum into 2025. But we'll obviously talk a bit more about that on our next call. But we will be watching for, you know, as David has mentioned in the past, we're not growing as quickly as we could.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"Just a follow-up on the consumer kind of credit front. You know, the charge-offs in the quarter, you noted, were kind of down on a year-on-year basis, but delinquencies were up. And, you know, the charge-offs being down, obviously, you know, kind of a good sign, you know, as many other lenders are seeing. You know, it's tough for consumers to kind of get out of delinquency once they're in it. Could you talk a little bit about, you know, how this quarter's, you know, delinquency rate is going to be reflected as you go forward and what it says about, you know, the portfolio performance?","Yeah, sure. So the consumer delinquency rate typically increases sequentially. If you go back and look over time between Q2 and Q3, which it did this quarter as well, year-over-year the comparison's a little different because we have had, you know, a slight mix shift. We had some strong demand from our cashnet business with great unit economics that over the past couple of quarters we met that demand, which allowed that business to grow a little bit faster than that credit. And that mix shift will create a little bit of a dynamic in the delinquency ratio. But I will tell you, even though we don't disclose our one-plus delinquency rate, the one-plus rate for consumer actually was down year-over-year. So it's really reflecting that mix shift. In an additional context, the fair value premium is also reflecting the fact that the unit economics framework for us, the risk-adjusted cash flows are incorporating that additional risk from the mix shift that I just mentioned with the flat fair value premium quarter-over-quarter.","The consumer delinquency rate increased sequentially this quarter, which is typical, but year-over-year comparisons show a slight decline in the one-plus delinquency rate due to a mix shift in business demand.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q3 2024,Financial Services,"I wanted to dig in a little more just in terms of the product mix. And specifically, I think Steve and Dave, you both had commented you're not growing as fast as you could, and not to diminish the impressive growth in consumer. SMB is growing materially faster recently. And I'm wondering, A, if you could just provide a little more color on maybe what differences you're seeing that is driving such a stronger growth and origination volumes among small businesses versus consumer. And B, circling back to your comment about not growing as fast as you could, is that applicable to both products, or is that mostly a commentary about the consumer?","Yeah, David, good question. I think it's mostly a factor of it's just a less mature product. Like in the consumer space, we have some very, very mature products that aren't growing as fast. We have some less mature products that are among our fastest growing products on the consumer side. But that's balanced out with some products that have been around for a very, very long time. And so that levels off the growth rate a little bit on the consumer side. And if we're small business, it's just much newer space overall and certainly much newer for us. And we've really only been aggressive in that space since kind of 2021. So I think that explains a little bit of the difference in growth rates. We're not seeing anything materially different like in the overall markets. And I think the competitive environment is pretty weak on both sides. In terms of could be growing faster, that's definitely applicable to both consumer and small business. And as you know from our conversations in the past, what that means is we just increase our internal unit economic targets, which are focused on ROEs, and just make our businesses try to achieve higher targets than maybe is necessary from a purely academic standpoint in terms of kind of the balance sheet of the business. But we just think that's the right risk-reward balance today, given that we are growing very quickly in a balance sheet intensive business.

So we're comfortable taking a little bit more cushion in those unit economic targets and growing kind of slower than we could have otherwise, albeit still at very, very attractive growth rates.","The speaker explains that the slower growth in the consumer sector is due to a mix of mature and less mature products, while the small business sector is newer and experiencing faster growth.

It looks like the full-year revenue growth outlook was taken up a bit. I believe it had been sort of high teens. Now it's 20%. give or take. Is there any change to the origination outlook? I think the last commentary was 15% or more growth on volumes.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2024,Financial Services,"Just trying to get a sense for how much of the improvement from sort of pre-pandemic levels you would characterize as mix-related, just a much bigger proponent of SMB, versus kind of where the credit box is now, and whether there are any expectations that as you perhaps loosen up the consumer credit box over time, should we expect a return to 2019 levels for losses, or is this sort of a new benchmark, a lower benchmark going forward?","Yeah, good question, David. Look, I think most of it is mixed, but it's not just consumer versus SMB mix. It's also mixed within the consumer business. So 2018, 2019, we're still doing lots of single pay lending, which has obviously much higher default and charge off rates. Now our consumer business is exclusively line of credit and installment products, which has much lower loss rates. So you have that you know, kind of those two different components of the mix shift, which has brought that down significantly. In terms of our credit box, I mean, we're reasonably open right now. We're not wide open for sure, but we're not super tight. I mean, the economic environment, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, the economic environment is good for our customers. Lots of jobs and good wage growth, and so we don't feel the need to be – super conservative. You know, we are probably, like I said, we're not as aggressive as we could be, but we're, you know, kind of reasonably aggressive, maybe a seven and a half out of 10 or eight out of 10 on the aggressiveness scale, which is normal. I mean, for us to be at like a five or below would mean something's wrong. So, you know, we're, you know, we're, we're, you know, kind of where we'd like to be. It's kind of our sweet spot kind of in this range, but they, the only thing, kind of smaller change, not a big one, but smaller change is what Steve alluded to. So we've had a shift within our SMB business to more higher yielding products. We just found higher returns there, better ROEs than at the very low end of kind of the yield spectrum from SMB where we get more competition with the banks. And so we're not totally out of that. We're not out of the lower APR stuff. We've just shifted more towards kind of the middle to upper end of our APR range for the SMB products. And so with those higher APRs come slightly higher defaults. So you'll see over the next few quarters, just slightly elevated compared to historic levels, default rates in the SMB business and eventually slightly higher net charge offs as a percentage of AR. But what will come along with that is higher yield and higher revenue, and so the ROEs on those products, those originations are looking really, really good.","The improvement from pre-pandemic levels is largely attributed to a shift in product mix, particularly within the consumer business, which now focuses on lower-risk lending options.

That's much, much more muted in the SMB space. So it's a nice thing about being a diversified business.

You know, it hasn't changed a ton over the last, you know, kind of four or five years that, you know, the main channels for us are what you would expect. We do a significant amount of direct mail, especially in the consumer business. I'm sure you've seen our TV both on the consumer SMB side. We've gotten heavier and heavier in TV.

So the marketing for Q1, the guide of upper teens as percent of revenue is against that expectation of our typical seasonality, particularly for the consumer portfolio, where we see lower levels of originations, typically our lowest point. But that's not implying that that's where we'll stick for the remainder of the year. So, seen in our past results, our marketing spend will vary with growth.

And you can see it can move three to four percentage points trough to peak. but it's very stable. So that variability doesn't imply that there's a change in the credit outlook. I think what we're implying is that we expect it to be relatively stable. And then I think on your question around mix, we don't expect a radical change in mix.

Are there other indicators that we should be tracking as we go through 2024 to kind of see both on the consumer and small business side that would kind of give us an indicator whether you're going to be pushing harder on originations or pulling back some?","Yeah, I think originations and demand is driven – A, by employment, because you can only lend if people are employed. And if people are feeling better about their future, they'll lever themselves up and spend a little bit more in the short term. So sentiment is definitely, it's sentiment and the labor market on the consumer side. On the small business side, I think there's two primary drivers. Again, small business sentiment, and there's a couple good surveys out there. But then also consumer spending. So much of small business revenue is driven by consumer spending. Big businesses aren't buying from small businesses. Governments aren't buying from small businesses. It's largely consumers. So if the consumers continue to spend, which they clearly have been throughout the last year, despite all the warnings to the contrary, small businesses tend to do well. And I think the longer that's continued and the the less likely a recession is more confident small businesses to become.

It's obviously below 60 for fourth quarter. Given that it sounded like some of your expected losses in SMB were actually more front end loaded in the third quarter, is this just a reflection of a bigger mix of new borrowers? Can you just give a little help on kind of what's behind maybe what seems like a little bit of a reduction in the fourth quarter?","Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. And I talked a little bit about it just to set up in the commentary where in our portfolios and at the consolidated level as we are navigating the seasonality that we have in some of our portfolios or just some of the balance that we've been talking about, which can, you know, exacerbate some of that seasonality from period to period, you can see us move around in the range. That doesn't mean that credit quality is worsening. And so I'll just tell you, like, we can land in our typical ranges for consumer and for small business So small business we talked about should improve quarter over quarter. I would expect it to be in our typical sort of more normal 4% to 5% range and with consumer relatively stable. The seasonality that we've seen over the past couple of quarters and that we expect going into Q4 is going to be the difference.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,"In terms of obviously the impact elevated demand, kind of leaning in to meet more of that with marketing. How do you think about in this environment, just given some of the uncertainties and to the extent that, at least for a lot of your consumers, you know, unemployment can't get any better. You know, do you get a, you know, are you worried that there's market share that you're going to lose if you don't mean it as heavily.

Just try to get a sense of the broader macro thought process because Innova does stand out among a lot of the companies we follow just in terms of the positivity towards customer acquisition, whereas a lot are stepping back.","Yeah. Look, I mean, it's a balance. We want to get every customer we can, but we don't want to be too aggressive and either spend too much to acquire those customers or build a portfolio of bad loans. And so that's the balance that we've managed super well over the last 10 years or so. We are comfortable pulling back when we need to because the Flip side is way worse. It's better to lose some customers than to find yourself with a portfolio that's not looking so good. And given that the relatively short nature of especially, well, even small business loans, both of them, the relatively short nature and especially on the consumer side where people don't, they're not always borrowing.

"Enova International, Inc.",Q3 2023,Financial Services,"Maybe can you talk about, you know, like payment rates and payment behaviors and even borrowing behaviors? And then beyond that, kind of what, is there something like in terms of mix within the SMB category that may have influenced the kind of temporary pickup and losses and, and, you know, your comfort that they're going to decline, um, into the fourth quarter.","Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me talk at a high level and Steve will probably jump in with a couple of numbers, but, but let me be very clear. I tried to be in my script. I'll do it again. We, look at payment rates every single day, every week, every month. And these loans that charge off at a higher rate than we've seen over the last few years are all from the back half of 2022, like almost all of them. And we can see payment rates by vintage for all the loans since then, so all this year. And if you look at those payment curves, every vintage this year is below every vintage last year. I mean, the curve looks like a giant spread out fan, which is what you... when you're trying to improve is exactly what you want to see. Basically, each month this year is better than the month before when you're looking in on vintage curves. So it wasn't mixed, wasn't a change in product, wasn't a change in competition, just we got a little bit too aggressive with our originations in the back half, you know, really three or four months of 2022, kind of late Q3 into Q4. And the lost emergence period on the small business products is kind of nine-ish months. And we knew that, and we tried to forecast it. And again, we were just off by a little bit in terms of the timing. Kind of thought the hit we took in Q3 would be more spread between Q3 and Q4, kind of September to October. You know, if we weren't a public company, it wasn't calendar, you know, if it wasn't a calendar quarter, wouldn't think twice about it, that they came like a couple weeks earlier versus a couple weeks later. But they did come in Q3 instead of Q4, you know, and that's where we ended up. But when we look at the credit performance of the loans that we've originated over the last nine months, they look very, very good. and that makes us confident about Q4 and going forward. And the only other thing I'll add that I did say in the script also is even those loans that had higher charge-off rates than we would have forecast at the time we originated them, still positive ROEs. I mean, we still made money on these loans, just not as much as we would have thought we would have made. But given the defaults, and the loans we've originated since. So this year, right back, you know, we expect to be right back at our target early.  John, let me add a couple things to think about as well. I mean, if you look at the quarterly metrics, and I've talked about this before, you kind of have to look at those in combination with our fair values, which give a better view of the overall expectation of how we expect the portfolio to perform. So there can be some variability quarter to quarter. You can see our loss rate ticked up a touch above the 5% for the quarter for the reasons we talked about. Delinquencies came down. And as we look out, the fair values of the portfolio actually ticked up a bit, which is reflecting the fact that a very large amount of the portfolio now consists of those vintages that David mentioned that are from early this year onward. So we expect that we're going to settle in at a more typical range from here as we've been adjusting. And obviously, we'll continue to adjust where we see uncertainty, but I think that's how you should think about from here how the credit quality should play out for the S&P boat.","The discussion focuses on payment and borrowing behaviors within the small business (SMB) category, highlighting that recent loan charge-offs were primarily from late 2022 due to aggressive originations, but current loan performance is strong, leading to confidence in future quarters.

Can you talk about maybe what incrementally you are monitoring or would like to see to expand beyond, I guess your phrase, moderately aggressive origination growth last quarter? What else is out there in your mind that's sort of casting a pall of uncertainty that maybe keeps you a little more restrained than you could be?","Yeah, I just think the overall risk in the economy and the recession risk going forward and, you know, I think we like others aren't seeing anything particularly troubling right now but, you know, we've never seen an economic environment quite like this. And with the Fed's aggressive stance, you know, could it tip the other way and be a harder landing than people expect? I think that's kind of what we're looking out for.

I mean, directionally, it seems like credit and everything else is performing as well as consumer, but it does look like you pulled back a bit this second quarter. Is there anything either competitively, cost of funds, or anything that makes you a little less aggressive than on the consumer side?","I just think given the larger loans and the slightly longer term in the SMB side versus consumer, we just want to be a bit more cautious with that portfolio. There's plenty of demand credit metrics, as we talked about in Q1, were a tad worse than we had thought they were going to be. But we've since normalized that, and they were much better in Q2. So we could be more aggressive, for sure. There's plenty of demand within our ROE targets on the SMB side. We're just not convinced the risk-reward is there right now, again, given the uncertainty in the economy. An extra few percentages of origination growth for us this year is pretty inconsequential. We're still growing at a significant premium to our PE.

But again, given the stability of the company, the strength of the balance sheet, our origination trajectory, you know, obviously no rush whatsoever.","The question inquires about a timeframe for exploring shareholder value opportunities, to which the answer indicates there is no rush, as the company is stable and in good shape, with ongoing efforts expected to create more value over time.",2,0,0.9999995,0.071428569,12,1,0.846153781,0.464285698,4,1,0.59999988,0.087719297,21,2,0.826086921,0.403508765,1,0,1,3,1,0
"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"On the credit side, I'm curious, you know, you're in a unique position being both a small business and a direct-to-consumer lender. Do you get any insights into layoff trends, employment trends through your SMB on-deck platform that can translate into consumer? And if so, is it still seeming pretty stable?","Not really. We don't get a great sense of that. I mean, we have a great sense of the health of small businesses generally, I would say we get a better sense of the health of the consumer from originating millions and millions of consumer loans. And especially as we've increasingly obtained electronic bank statement data from our customers as part of those originations, we get a very good sense of employment trends, changes in employment, changes in income. And I can say the consumer is still very, very strong Unemployment rates, you know, kind of at or near lows. You know, jobless claims have ticked up a teeny bit, but still very, very, very low. Wages are still incredibly strong. So we're seeing a very healthy consumer. And as I mentioned in my call, we've had some of the strongest credit metrics we've ever had in Q1 of this year. And, you know, combined with very solid demand, it's making for a strong consumer business for us right now.","The lender does not gain significant insights into layoff trends from their small business platform, but they observe strong consumer health through their loan origination data. Employment rates remain low, wages are robust, and credit metrics are at their highest, indicating a stable consumer environment.",3,1,0.499999875,0.159999994,7,1,0.749999906,0.319999987,5,2,0.428571367,0.10447761,21,7,0.499999982,0.417910442,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"And then I'll wrap up to a quick question on marketing and customer acquisition. Obviously, we understand that 20% is more of a normalized level. It can fluctuate quarter to quarter. But is there anything in the competitive environment, specifically just competitors that don't have the access to funding or as low-cost funding as you do, Is there anything about weakened competition that could kind of lead that customer acquisition spend to be below 20% this year, you know, to be usually efficient, if you will?","Yeah, I mean, look, it's a balance. The competitive environment is certainly weak. We definitely saw that in Q1. Our credit models, as we discussed in our Q4 call – We're pretty tight throughout the majority of the quarter with, you know, kind of our elevated ROE targets that we've now talked about for a couple quarters in a row. And even with that, you know, we had much lower marketing as a percentage of revenue than I think that we've had since we acquired ONDEC, at least since post the pandemic. So that, you know, that weakened economic environment certainly helps. The flip side of that is with the good credit metrics and entering a more seasonably attractive time of year, that gives us incentive to accelerate originations a bit, which I also mentioned on the call. And those could push up the metrics a bit because it's important to remember there's two ways of accelerating origination. You can open up your credit model and bring in more lower credit quality customers, or you can spend more per customer and attract more higher credit quality customers. And we vary those tactics based on what we're seeing in our data each and every day. We're twisting those dials each and every day to adjust marketing spend and adjust where our credit metrics are. But certainly, as we mentioned, as Steve wrapped up with in this balanced approach between risk and growth, we're more sensitive to opening up the credit models too much. you know, that might push us a bit to spend a tiny bit more on marketing. The good news is with that very low, you know, marketing number in Q1, we have plenty of room to do that and still have very attractive ROEs.","The question inquires about the potential impact of weakened competition on customer acquisition spending, particularly if it could fall below the normalized 20% level. The answer indicates that while the competitive environment is weak, allowing for lower marketing costs, the company is balancing risk and growth by adjusting their credit models and marketing spend based on current data, with room to increase spending while maintaining attractive returns on equity.",2,2,0,0.129032254,7,6,0.076923071,0.419354825,4,2,0.333333278,0.051724137,35,8,0.627906962,0.370689652,2,0,0,4,0,0
"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"First question is, this seems to be, you know, I've been tracking this, I guess, loosely. They put out some small business data collection, I guess, proposals. I just, what's your general commentary to that, and does that do anything from an operational perspective to you guys?","Yeah, I mean, that's now a final rule. It goes into effect, I think we have to start collecting in 2024. I can't remember the exact date. I think we report for the first time in 2025. I might be off a teeny bit on that, but I think that's about right. There's similar to what's going, you know, what you have to do with mortgage lending these days. They want, you know, demographic type data, gender, race, those kinds of things. Super easy for us as an online lender to collect. It's not mandatory. It's voluntary for the customer. So we just add a couple fields to our application. They fill it in or not fill it in, and then we send the data to CFPB. So really not much of a burden for us at all.","The question inquires about new small business data collection proposals and their operational impact. The answer confirms that a final rule will take effect in 2024, requiring demographic data collection, which is easy for the online lender to implement and poses minimal burden since it's voluntary for customers.",0,1,-0.999999,0.066666662,3,1,0.499999875,0.266666649,2,0,0.9999995,0.038461538,11,1,0.833333264,0.230769226,1,0,0,1,0,1
"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"And then you mentioned credit is getting better into the second quarter, and I think that's despite the fact that most of us are aware that tax refunds are down a little bit this year, actually down quite a bit. So is that a function of tightening? Is that a function of mix? Obviously, yes, you guys are in the markets managing credit risk. So obviously, it's the platform. But, you know, relative to where I kind of thought I heard that, you know, you were very pleased and maybe the credit might be forming a little better than expected. I mean, I'm just wondering kind of what your perspective is on the attribution of that result.","Sure. Well, not better than expected. It performed well. But let me break it up into two components because they were slightly different, which was part of the point I was trying to make when kind of going through how we manage credit. On the consumer side, credit was extremely strong all quarter. And, you know, almost from the very beginning of the quarter, we saw some of the strongest credit metrics we've really ever seen in the consumer business. And yeah, tax returns are down a little bit, but as I mentioned in the answer to David's question, the consumer, as far as we can see, is still very, very strong with the strong jobs market and strong wages. So that, with us not being super aggressive with terms of origination, that balanced approach to risk and growth, I think led to those very, very good credit metrics, and that's continued so far into Q2. On the small business side, we did see a little bit of weakness in credit at the end of 2022, and we were very aggressive with origination, so I'm sure that was part of it. And I do think businesses also got a bit skittish kind of around the end of the year and then into Q1. But again, our models work really, really well, and our team is incredibly good at their jobs and Again, by twisting and turning those dials and, you know, by the machine learning models adjusting, you know, by the end of the quarter, small business credit was looking very solid again. So, you know, not all-time great, like on the consumer side, but certainly that to a range we're very happy with.","The respondent indicates that while consumer credit metrics were exceptionally strong in Q1, small business credit showed some weakness but improved by the end of the quarter. They attribute the positive consumer credit performance to a strong job market and a balanced approach to risk, despite lower tax refunds.",4,2,0.333333278,0.13333333,15,5,0.499999975,0.444444435,5,3,0.249999969,0.074766354,26,14,0.299999993,0.373831772,3,0,0,2,0,0
"Enova International, Inc.",Q1 2023,Financial Services,"First question also on small business. So, you know, we have these kind of big turmoil over the past, you know, since mid-March. And since then, we've heard of banks starting to tighten up on certain types of lending categories, and small business seems to be one of them. I'm sort of just wondering if you're hearing or seeing anything and how the competitive landscape is looking for you, and perhaps if there might be some opportunities of others pulled back from small business lending. Thank you.","Yeah, no, great question. In general, our small business products are structured to attract businesses that generally can't qualify for traditional loans from banks. So there's not a direct overlap. But over time, as those banks continue to pull back, obviously those small businesses that maybe historically would have been able to get a bank loan no longer will be able to. And as they search out cash, we do think we are a viable option for them. So We haven't seen a ton of that yet. We didn't see a spike of volume in March, but that's not unexpected. I mean, those businesses that have traditionally borrowed from banks, it could take them some time to adjust to having to borrow from a different type of lender. But that banking pullback does seem to be continuing. So I think as we look forward, you know, into Q2, into the summer, If that pullback continues, it's certainly an opportunity for our small business products.","The question inquires about the impact of banks tightening small business lending since mid-March and potential opportunities for alternative lenders. The answer explains that their small business products cater to those who typically can't secure traditional loans, and as banks continue to pull back, they anticipate an increase in demand for their services.",1,3,-0.499999875,0.124999996,6,4,0.19999998,0.31249999,3,2,0.19999996,0.081967212,18,3,0.71428568,0.344262289,3,0,0,3,0,0
